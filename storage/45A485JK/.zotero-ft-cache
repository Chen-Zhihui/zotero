NormFace: L2 HyperSphere Embedding for Face Verification

http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alanlab/Pubs17/wang2017normface.pdf
Baseline Model 	Original Accuracy 	Finetune Using Normalization
Light CNN(MaxOut)   	98.41%*   	98.78%
Center Face(ResNet) 	99.03% 	99.21%

* It is 98.13% on Light CNN's project page . After applying the mirror face trick , it becomes 98.41%.
Requirements

    My Caffe ( https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows/tree/ms ). It also works on Linux. Anyway, if you want to use your own Caffe, please transplant the inner_product_layer , inner_distance_layer , normalize_layer , general_contrastive_layer , flip_layer and accuracy_layer to your Caffe. Since there are too many layers to transplant, I suggest you to use my Caffe directly:)
    Matlab to draw some figures.
    GPU with CUDA support.
    MTCNN face and facial landmark detector( https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment ).
    Baseline model such as Center Face or Light CNN or your own model trained by softmax loss. I don't know whether my loss helps or not if your model is trained by other loss functions. You may have a try. I believe it will be effective if there is no normalization term in your model.

Train

    The dataset used in this paper is CASIA-Webface . Note that there are 3 identities overlap between CASIA-Webface and LFW. They are 0166921 , 1056413 and 1193098 . For fair evaluation, it is recommended to remove them from CAISA-Webface. Update: Actually there are 17 overlap identities, the list is in my FaceDatasets repository .
    Align all face images using MTCNN. The script can be found in my FaceVerification repository .
    Replace the final inner-product layer and softmax layer with layers defined in scaled_cosine_softmax.prototxt or normalized_Euclidean_contrastive.prototxt .
    Fine-tune the network based on the original model using a small learning rate, say 0.001 or 0.0001.

Evaluation

Evaluation codes are in my another github repository . Please refer to the second paragraph of the Update section.

A trick called mirror face is used during extracting the features. A sample code is in ./prototxt/example_of_mirror_face.prototxt .

About the mirror face: See ./MirrorFace.md

About the histogram feature for video face verification: Details are in ./YTF .
Trained Models

Light CNN B model(98.78%): Google Drive or Baidu Yun .

ps: I used to get a model of 98.8%, but I lost it....

Center Face (ResNet-27) model(99.21%): Google Drive or Baidu Yun .
