ZoomGrid

ZoomGrid is a grid which can zoom its cells. In other words, it's a two-dimensional accordion menu inside a fixed rectangle.
How to use

Copy ZoomGrid.js (along with any optional extension) into your web folder and add a corresponding <script/> tag for each file to the <head/> element of your page:

 <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/ZoomGrid.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/ZoomGridTransparency.js"></script>  

Then invoke the grid:

 var z = new ZoomGrid( { container: document.getElementById( "Contents" ) } );  

In this case, you should have a <div id="Contents"/> somewhere on your page, of course. After that, you need to activate the extensions you want to use. For example, to activate the transparency extension do:

 z.addTransparency();  

Some extensions may require attributes. Just look at the corresponding source file.
