libMXF

libMXF is a software library written by BBC Research to read and write MXF files. It has been optimised for real-time capture and playout in broadcast environments, and for interoperability with editing systems such as Avid Media Composer.

Source code can be browsed and downloaded from the CVS repository .

Nightly builds as binary release snapshots for MS Windows, Mac OS X and Linux are available here .
Tools
Included with libMXF are a number of tools:

    writeavidmxf - takes uncompressed video or audio, DV25/50, IMX, JPEG, DNxHD and DVCProHD files and writes MXF OP-Atom files which can be used directly in Avid Media Composer and related editors.
    E.g.
    writeavidmxf --prefix rushes --dv25 rushes.dv --wavpcm rushes.wav
    This writes three files (rushes_v1.mxf, rushes_a1.mxf, rushes_a2.mxf) which can be dropped straight into the /Avid MediaFiles/MXF/1 directory and used immediately by Avid editors.
    Run writeavidmxf without options to see full command usage.
