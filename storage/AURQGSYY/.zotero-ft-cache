WebPie

WebPie is a pie menu for web pages. Its appearance is very similar to PieDock .
How to use

Place both files somewhere in your web project and add those two lines to the <head/> element of your web page:

 <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/WebPieIcon.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/WebPie.js"></script>  

Next you'll have to set up the menu, for example:

 <script type="text/javascript"> var wp = new WebPie( { icons: [ new WebPieIcon( "path/to/icon.png", function(){ alert( "First" ); } ), new WebPieIcon( "path/to/icon.png", function(){ alert( "Second" ); } ), new WebPieIcon( "path/to/icon.png", function(){ alert( "Third" ); } ) ] } ); wp.create(); </script>
