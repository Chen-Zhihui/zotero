Boost asio UDT implementation

This project is a an implementation of the UDT protocol based on Boost asio components and philosophy (socket, timer, asynchronous model).
How to use

The library complies with asio's API.

As you would have used TCP socket :

    boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket
    boost::asio::ip::tcp::acceptor
    boost::asio::ip::tcp::resolver
    boost::asio::ip::tcp::resolver::query

The library provides UDT socket :

    ip::udt<>::socket
    ip::udt<>::acceptor
    ip::udt<>::resolver
    ip::udt<>::resolver::query

UDT protocol can be customized with template parameters :

    The first one is a Logger. By default there is no logging but it is possible to use a FileLogger which log internal variables for statistics. A python script is available to display logs as graphs.
    The second one is the congestion algorithm. By default, this is the standard congestion algorithm. Feel free to suggest and implement your own algorithm.

At the moment, this library does not support the rendez-vous connection feature.

Examples :

    client
    server

Feel free to contribute, leave feedbacks or report issues !
