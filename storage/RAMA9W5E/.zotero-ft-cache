CUDA/C++11 cmake starter with google test and google benchmark

License: MIT

A cross-platform CUDA/C++11 starter project with google test and google benchmark support.

See this project for a similar starter for C++11 only.
Build

On Linux/Unix, to build and make the test:

 $ mkdir build && cd $_ $ cmake .. $ make  

By default, the makefiles will build the library, executable, tests, and benchmarks. The commands

 $ ./test/deepgreen_tests $ ./bench/deepgreen_benchmark  

...will run the tests and benchmarks.

On Windows, you can use cmake to generate Visual Studio build files with the same 'cmake ..' command.

By default, the project will be built in RELEASE mode, use

 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG  

to build in DEBUG mode.

See the CMakeLists.txt file to see all the options.
