Overview

The Deep Face Representation Experiment is based on Convolution Neural Network to learn a robust feature for face verification task. The popular deep learning framework caffe is used for training on face datasets such as CASIA-WebFace, VGG-Face and MS-Celeb-1M. And the feature extraction is realized by python code caffe_ftr.py .

Description

Data Pre-processing

    Download face dataset such as CASIA-WebFace, VGG-Face and MS-Celeb-1M.
    All face images are converted to gray-scale images and normalized to 144x144 according to landmarks.
    According to the 5 facial points, we not only rotate two eye points horizontally but also set the distance between the midpoint of eyes and the midpoint of mouth(ec_mc_y), and the y axis of midpoint of eyes(ec_y) .

Dataset 	size 	ec_mc_y 	ec_y
Training set 	144x144 	48 	48
Testing set 	128x128 	48 	40

Training

    The model is trained by open source deep learning framework caffe .
    The network configuration is showed in "proto" file and the trained model is showed in "model" file.

Evaluation

    The model is evaluated on LFW which is a popular data set for face verification task.
    The extracted features and lfw testing pairs are located in "results" file.
    To evaluate the model, the matlab code or other ROC evaluation code can be used.
    The model is also evaluated on MegaFace. The dataset and evaluation code can be downloaded from http://megaface.cs.washington.edu/

Results

The single convolution net testing is evaluated on unsupervised setting only computing cosine similarity for lfw pairs.
Model 	100% - EER 	TPR@FAR=1% 	TPR@FAR=0.1% 	TPR@FAR=0 	Rank-1 	DIR@FAR=1%
A 	97.77% 	94.80% 	84.37% 	43.17% 	84.79% 	63.09%
B 	98.13% 	96.73% 	87.13% 	64.33% 	89.21% 	69.46%
C 	98.80% 	98.60% 	96.77% 	94.97% 	93.80% 	84.40%
