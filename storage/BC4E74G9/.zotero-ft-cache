Face-alignment-in-3000fps

This project is a C++ reimplementation of face alignment in 3000fps in the CVPR 2014 paper: Face Alignment at 3000 FPS via Regressing Local Binary Features. .
Update openMP support !!!

I modify my code to support openMP. You can use it in GCC(Linux) or in VS (Windows).

If you use it in Linux, you should comment or uncomment FIND_PACKAGE( OpenMP REQUIRED) in CmakeLists.txt.

If you use it in Windows, you can directly use it.
VS project

I add a VS project.
Usage

    Download datasets and get Path_Images.txt as jwyang/face-alignment .

    To compiler the program: go to folder build and

    cmake .

    make

    To train a new model: set global parameters, model path, train database name in LBF.cpp . Use "LBF.out TrainModel" .

    To test a model on dataset: set model path, test dataset name in LBF.cpp . Use "LBF.out TestModel" .

###Model I have trained a model on AFW, HELEN,LFPW dataset. You can download it from here or google drive .
FAQ

    How to get the bounding box of image ?

    I use the face detector in OpenCV to get the bounding box.You can use any detector to get the bounding box but you must provide a bounding box of similar measure with the training data.

    How about the liblinear?

    I add the liblinear source code as the project code. So you can directly compiler this project and don't need to consider to compiler this library.
