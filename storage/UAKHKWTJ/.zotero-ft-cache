Facenet implementation by Keras2
Pretrained model

You can quickly start facenet with pretrained Keras model (trained by MS-Celeb-1M dataset).

    Download model from here and save it in model/keras/

You can also create Keras model from pretrained tensorflow model.

    Download model from here and save it in model/tf/
    Convert model for Keras in tf_to_keras.ipynb

Demo

    Face vector calculation
    Classification with SVM
    Web camera demo

Environments

Ubuntu16.04 or Windows10
python3.6.2
tensorflow: 1.3.0
keras: 2.1.2
