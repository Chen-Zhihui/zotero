The Xapian Project
Xapian is taking part in Google Summer of Code this year - here's our list of project ideas .

Welcome to the Xapian project website.

Xapian is an Open Source Search Engine Library, released under the GPL v2+ . It's written in C++ , with bindings to allow use from Perl , Python 2 , Python 3 , PHP 5 , PHP 7 , Java , Tcl , C# , Ruby , Lua , Erlang , Node.js and R (so far!)

Xapian is a highly adaptable toolkit which allows developers to easily add advanced indexing and search facilities to their own applications. It has built-in support for several families of weighting models and also supports a rich set of boolean query operators.

If you're after a packaged search engine for your website, you should take a look at Omega : an application we supply built upon Xapian. Unlike most other website search solutions, Xapian's versatility allows you to extend Omega to meet your needs as they grow.

The latest stable version is 1.4.7 , released on 2018-07-19.

The latest old stable version is 1.2.25 , released on 2017-09-26.
