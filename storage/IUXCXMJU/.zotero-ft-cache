A WikiProject is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for example, mathematics ), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages ). The English Wikipedia currently has over 2,000 WikiProjects, about 1,000 of which are monitored by 30–2,000 editors and all with varying levels of activity.

    Main page: What is a WikiProject? 
    See also: FAQs about WikiProjects 

A WikiProject is fundamentally a social construct: its success depends on its ability to function as a cohesive group of editors working towards a common goal. The pages of a WikiProject are the central place for editor collaboration on a particular topic area. Editors there develop criteria, maintain various collaborative processes, keep track of work that needs to be done, and act as a forum where issues of interest to the editors of a subject may be discussed. WikiProjects often write advice for editors, use bots to track what is happening at articles of interest to the group, and create lists of tools and templates their members commonly use. The discussion pages attached to a project page are a convenient forum for those involved in that project to talk about what they are doing, to ask questions, and to receive advice from other people interested in the group's work. Members of WikiProjects also assist in performing quality assessments of articles pertaining to their specific topic area.

They typically are areas of interest or expertise and can be used for collaboration, coordination, competitions, outreach, decision-making, integration and mutual assistance.

WikiProjects are not rule-making organizations, nor can they assert ownership of articles within a specific topic area. WikiProjects have no special rights or privileges compared to other editors and may not impose their preferences on articles .

Creating and maintaining a project

    Main page: Creating a WikiProject 

Creating a WikiProject is the process of creating a group of people who want to work together.

Before starting, read the guide to WikiProject organization , and peruse some existing WikiProjects to understand how they operate in practice. If you're not sure about creating a new project, or aren't certain if anyone else is interested, you can make a WikiProject proposal . Groups of like-minded editors may start new WikiProjects at any time and are encouraged, but not obligated, to propose them before doing so. Formal proposals have many advantages, including receiving valuable input, and saving a lot of work, and recruiting potential members.
