Simple HTML5 Charts using the canvas element chartjs.org
Installation

You can download the latest version of Chart.js from the GitHub releases or use a Chart.js CDN .

To install via npm:

 npm install chart.js --save

To install via bower:

 bower install chart.js --save

Selecting the Correct Build

Chart.js provides two different builds for you to choose: Stand-Alone Build , Bundled Build .
Stand-Alone Build

Files:

    dist/Chart.js
    dist/Chart.min.js

The stand-alone build includes Chart.js as well as the color parsing library. If this version is used, you are required to include Moment.js before Chart.js for the functionality of the time axis.
Bundled Build

Files:

    dist/Chart.bundle.js
    dist/Chart.bundle.min.js

The bundled build includes Moment.js in a single file. You should use this version if you require time axes and want to include a single file. You should not use this build if your application already included Moment.js. Otherwise, Moment.js will be included twice which results in increasing page load time and possible version compatability issues.
Documentation

You can find documentation at www.chartjs.org/docs . The markdown files that build the site are available under /docs . Previous version documentation is available at www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/#previous-versions .
