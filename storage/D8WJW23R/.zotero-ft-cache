Position of landmark points (1-12), that were used for morphometric analysis of shells of Nucella lapillus .

In morphometrics , landmark point or shortly landmark is a point in a shape object in which correspondences between and within the populations of the object are preserved. In other disciplines, landmarks may be known as vertices , anchor points, control points, sites, profile points, 'sampling' points, nodes, markers, fiducial markers , etc. Landmarks can be defined either manually by experts or automatically by a computer program . There are three basic types of landmarks: anatomical landmarks, mathematical landmarks or pseudo-landmarks.

An anatomical landmark is a biologically -meaningful point in an organism . Usually experts define anatomical points to ensure their correspondences within the same species . Examples of anatomical landmark in shape of a skull are the eye corner, tip of the nose, jaw, etc. Anatomical landmarks determine homologous parts of an organism, which share a common ancestry.

Mathematical landmarks are points in a shape that are located according to some mathematical or geometrical property, for instance, a high curvature point or an extreme point . A computer program usually determines mathematical landmarks used for an automatic pattern recognition .

Pseudo-landmarks are constructed points located between anatomical or mathematical landmarks. A typical example is an equally spaced set of points between two anatomical landmarks to get more sample points from a shape. Pseudo-landmarks are useful during shape matching, when the matching process requires a large number of points.
