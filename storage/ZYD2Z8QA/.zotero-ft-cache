    Default Url protocol scheme

        Hi, last time I am trying to implement a Url protocol scheme, How it works ? Very simple, as first we need to register a url scheme in our system, to assign url address with our app and then we can send some message using web browser address bar.

        Code to register url address

        Qt Code:
        Switch view

         

         
            bool Settings :: registerProtocol ( )
            {
            #ifdef Q_OS_WIN
            const QString urlScheme = "myapp" ;
            const QString appPath = QDir :: toNativeSeparators ( QCoreApplication :: applicationFilePath ( ) ) ;
            const QString regPath = QStringLiteral ( "HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\ Software \\ Classes \\ " ) + urlScheme;
             
            QScopedPointer<QSettings> reg ( new QSettings ( regPath, QSettings :: NativeFormat ) ) ;
             
            reg - >setValue ( QStringLiteral ( "Default" ) , "download manager" ) ;
            reg - >setValue ( QStringLiteral ( "URL Protocol" ) , QString ( ) ) ;
             
            reg - >beginGroup ( QStringLiteral ( "DefaultIcon" ) ) ;
            reg - >setValue ( QStringLiteral ( "Default" ) , QString ( "%1,1" ) . arg ( appPath ) ) ;
            reg - >endGroup ( ) ;
             
            reg - >beginGroup ( QStringLiteral ( "shell" ) ) ;
            reg - >beginGroup ( QStringLiteral ( "open" ) ) ;
            reg - >beginGroup ( QStringLiteral ( "command" ) ) ;
            reg - >setValue ( QStringLiteral ( "Default" ) , appPath + QLatin1String ( " %1" ) ) ;
             
            return true ;
             
            #elif defined(Q_OS_UNIX)
            //TODO
            Logger :: getInstance ( ) - >Info ( tr ( "Cannot integrate with web browser - unsupported system" ) ) ;
            return false ;
            #endif
            return false ;
            }
         

         

         bool Settings::registerProtocol()
        {
           #ifdef Q_OS_WIN
           const QString urlScheme = "myapp";
           const QString appPath = QDir::toNativeSeparators(QCoreApplication::applicationFilePath());
           const QString regPath = QStringLiteral("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\") + urlScheme;

           QScopedPointer<QSettings> reg(new QSettings(regPath, QSettings::NativeFormat));

           reg->setValue(QStringLiteral("Default"), "download manager");
           reg->setValue(QStringLiteral("URL Protocol"), QString());

           reg->beginGroup(QStringLiteral("DefaultIcon"));
           reg->setValue(QStringLiteral("Default"), QString("%1,1").arg(appPath));
           reg->endGroup();

           reg->beginGroup(QStringLiteral("shell"));
           reg->beginGroup(QStringLiteral("open"));
           reg->beginGroup(QStringLiteral("command"));
           reg->setValue(QStringLiteral("Default"), appPath + QLatin1String(" %1"));

           return true;

           #elif defined(Q_OS_UNIX)
           //TODO
           Logger::getInstance()->Info(tr("Cannot integrate with web browser - unsupported system"));
           return false;
           #endif
           return false;
        }

        To copy to clipboard, switch view to plain text mode 

        Receiving messages

        Qt Code:
        Switch view

         

         
            void MainWindow :: checkApplicationArguments ( )
            {
            for ( int i = 0 ; i < QCoreApplication :: arguments ( ) . count ( ) ; i ++ )
            {
            QString arg = QCoreApplication :: arguments ( ) . at ( i ) ;
            if ( arg. contains ( "myapp:[" ) )
            {
            //do something
            }
            }
            }
         

         

         void MainWindow::checkApplicationArguments()
        {
            for(int i = 0; i < QCoreApplication::arguments().count(); i++)
            {
               QString arg = QCoreApplication::arguments().at(i);
               if(arg.contains("myapp:["))
               {
                   //do something
               }
            }
        }

        To copy to clipboard, switch view to plain text mode 

        ... and then if we will register it, we can enter a message into web browser address bar and send it to our app, for example:
        Qt Code:
        Switch view

         

         
            myapp : [ hello ]
         

         

         myapp:[hello]

        To copy to clipboard, switch view to plain text mode 
        then program will start and we can receive our message, but I'm wondering and I have completely no idea how to receive a message when app is currently running... normally web browser tries to open a new instance of application...
        Have you got some idea how to handle application args when program is open ? I know that this is possible, I have seen it in different app about two years ago but the project is no longer being developed and I can't remember how it worked...

        Thank you for time spent reading this topic
        Cheers

        I believe you will have to subclass QNetworkAccessManager to implement your own protocol and then see the doc for QNetworkAccessManager::supportedSchemesImplementation() . 

        I write the best type of code possible, code that I want to write, not code that someone tells me to write!

        You are looking for something like a single instance application.
        E.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5...app-protection

        I've got single instance app protection using QSharedMemory

        I've attached example app

        http://www79.zippyshare.com/v/gW9uCi3f/file.html

        Please open it, and click button "Enable integration with web browsers", then close app and enter myapp:[hello] into web browser address bar.
        App will start and you will see received message, but how can I get message when app is already running ?

        Cheers

        That's what single instance mechanisms usually do.
        They detect that there is an already running instance and then pass the argument to the running instance.

        Since you implement your own single instance mechanism, it is also up to you to implement instance communication.
