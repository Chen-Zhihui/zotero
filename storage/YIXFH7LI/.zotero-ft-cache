1. SVM

An implementation of the "MP-BCFW" algorithm described in

    A Multi-Plane Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe Algorithm for Training Structural SVMs with a Costly max-Oracle.
    Neel Shah, Vladimir Kolmogorov and Christoph H. Lampert.
    In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( CVPR ), June 2015. 

    SVM-v1.03.zip


2. SRMP

An implementation of the "SRMP" algorithm described in

    A new look at reweighted message passing.
    Vladimir Kolmogorov.
    In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, May 2015 . 

    SRMP-v1.01.zip

SRMP generalizes TRW-S to higher-order graphical models. For pairwise graphical models the original implementation of TRW-S should be faster (e.g. by a factor of 3 for the case of two labels, in one informal test). For a larger number of labels the difference should be smaller: the runtime would be dominated by distance transform operations whose implementations are similar.

3. POTTS

An implementation of the algorithm described in

    Potts model, parametric maxflow and k-submodular functions.
    Igor Gridchyn and Vladimir Kolmogorov.
    In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2013 . 

    Potts-v1.1.src.zip


4. BLOSSOM V

An implementation of a minimum cost perfect matching algorithm described in

    Blossom V: A new implementation of a minimum cost perfect matching algorithm.
    Vladimir Kolmogorov.
    In Mathematical Programming Computation (MPC), July 2009, 1(1):43-67. 

    blossom5-v2.05.src.tar.gz

(The experiments in the paper were performed using version 1.0 . A description of changes is here .)

The code can also be used for computing a maximum (non-perfect) matching: the latter problem can be reduced to a perfect matching problem via a reduction described in section 1.5.1 of Guido Sch√§fer's Master's thesis . This reduction doubles the size of the graph.

The code above is licensed for research purposes only. Commercial licensing of Blossom V is available through the UCL Business e-licensing website .

5. GRAPH MATCHING

An implementation of a dual decomposition technique for the graph matching optimization problem described in

    Feature Correspondence via Graph Matching: Models and Global Optimization.
    Lorenzo Torresani, Vladimir Kolmogorov and Carsten Rother.
    In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), October 2008 . 

    GraphMatching-v1.02.src.zip


6. MAXFLOW

An implementation of the maxflow algorithm described in

    An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Computer Vision.
    Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov.
    In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, September 2004 . 

Note that all experimental results reported in the paper are based on original implementation of our algorithm that we developed while at Siemens Corp. Research (Princeton, NJ). We are not allowed to distribute that version. Below is a comparable version that I later independently re-implemented based on published materials.

Old version 2.22 is still available . Commercial licensing of MaxFlow (vsn 2.22) is available through the UCL Business e-licensing website .
