DB Browser for SQLite Screenshot
What it is

DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

It is for users and developers wanting to create databases, search, and edit data. It uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and you don't need to learn complicated SQL commands.

Controls and wizards are available for users to:

    Create and compact database files
    Create, define, modify and delete tables
    Create, define and delete indexes
    Browse, edit, add and delete records
    Search records
    Import and export records as text
    Import and export tables from/to CSV files
    Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files
    Issue SQL queries and inspect the results
    Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application
    Plot simple graphs based on table or query data

What it is not

This program is not a visual shell for the sqlite command line tool. It does not require familiarity with SQL commands. It is a tool to be used both by developers and by end users, and it must remain as simple to use as possible in order to achieve its goals.
Nightly builds

Nightly builds for Windows and OSX can be downloaded here:

    https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest

Windows

Windows releases can be downloaded here:

    https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases

Note - If for some reason the standard Windows release doesn't work for you (eg it gives an error), try a nightly build. They often fix bugs reported after the last release. :D
MacOS X / macOS

DB Browser for SQLite works well on MacOS X / macOS.

    OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion) - 10.13 (High Sierra) are tested and known to work

OSX releases can be downloaded here:

    https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases

Latest OSX binary can be installed via Homebrew Cask :

 brew cask install db-browser-for-sqlite  

Linux

DB Browser for SQLite works well on Linux.
Arch Linux

Arch Linux provides a package through pacman.
Fedora

For Fedora (i386 and x86_64) you can install by issuing:

 $ sudo dnf install sqlitebrowser  

Debian

Note that Debian focuses more on stability rather than newest features. Therefore packages will typically contain some older (but well tested) version, compared to the latest release.

Update the cache using:

 sudo apt-get update  

Install the package using:

 sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser  

Ubuntu and Derivatives
Stable release

For Ubuntu and derivaties, @deepsidhu1313 provides a PPA with our latest release here:

    https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser

To add this ppa just type in these commands in terminal:

 sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser  

Then update the cache using:

 sudo apt-get update  

Install the package using:

 sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser  

Ubuntu 14.04.X, 15.04.X, 15.10.X and 16.04.X are supported for now (until Launchpad decides to discontinue building for any series).

Ubuntu Precise (12.04) and Utopic (14.10) are not supported:

    Precise doesn't have a new enough Qt package in its repository by default, which is a dependency
    Launchpad doesn't support Utopic any more, as that has reached its End of Life

Nightly builds

Nightly builds are available here:

    https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser-testing

To add this ppa just type in these commands in terminal:

 sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser-testing  

Then update the cache using:

 sudo apt-get update  

Install the package using:

 sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser  

Other Linux

On others you'll need to compile it yourself using the (simple) instructions in BUILDING.md .
FreeBSD

DB Browser for SQLite works well on FreeBSD, and there is a port for it (thanks to lbartoletti ðŸ˜„ ). It can be installed using either this:

 # make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlitebrowser install  

or this:

 # pkg install sqlitebrowser  

Compiling

Instructions for compiling on (at least) Windows, OSX, Linux, and FreeBSD are in BUILDING .

History

This program was developed originally by Mauricio Piacentini ( @piacentini ) from Tabuleiro Producoes, as the Arca Database Browser. The original version was used as a free companion tool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data.

The original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard SQLite 2.x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database Browser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio. Icons were contributed by Raquel Ravanini , also from Tabuleiro. Jens Miltner ( @jmiltner ) contributed the code to support SQLite 3.x databases for the 1.2 release.

Pete Morgan ( @daffodil ) created an initial project on GitHub with the code in 2012, where several contributors fixed and improved pieces over the years. RenÃ© Peinthor ( @rp- ) and Martin Kleusberg ( @MKleusberg ) then became involved, and have been the main driving force from that point. Justin Clift ( @justinclift ) helps out with testing on OSX, and started the new github.com/sqlitebrowser organisation on GitHub.

John T. Haller , of PortableApps.com fame, created the new logo. He based it on the Tango icon set (public domain).

In August 2014, the project was renamed to "Database Browser for SQLite" at the request of Richard Hipp (creator of SQLite ), as the previous name was creating unintended support issues.

In September 2014, the project was renamed to "DB Browser for SQLite", to avoid confusion with an existing application called "Database Browser".
