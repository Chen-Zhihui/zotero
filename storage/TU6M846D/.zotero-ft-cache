DicomBrowser

This is a lightweight portable Dicom browser application written in Python. It allows Dicom directories to be loaded, images and tag data viewed, and not much else aside. This is intended to be a cross-platform utility suitable for previewing Dicom data rather than doing any sort of processing.
Installation

DicomBrowser requires Python 2.7/3.* , PyQt4/5 , numpy , pydicom and pyqtgraph , the latter two are submodules of this project. Ensure these packages are installed, in the case of pydicom and pyqtgraph ensure the submodules are included in your clone:

 git clone --recursive https://github.com/ericspod/DicomBrowser.git  

DicomBrowser can be installed using the setup.py script (although this isn't necessary, see below):

 python setup.py install  

This will generate the necessary files for the UI, install the module, and create a script to run the application from the command line called DicomBrowser , but will not install other needed packages. Ensure the pydicom and pyqtgraph submodules have been checked out and then run the above command in each to install them.

PyQt4/5 must be acquired through your package manager or through its website. Numpy can be installed through your package manager, the website, or pip :

 pip install numpy  

Generating the packaged executables requires pyinstaller , clone and install from https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller if you want to generate these yourself.
Running

DicomBrowser can be run directly as a module from the project's directory:

 python -m DicomBrowser  

The releases also include pre-built Windows and OSX standalone applications, allowing you to download these and run the application without installing Python or the necessary packages.

Directories provided as command line arguments will be imported, any other arguments or files will be ignored.
