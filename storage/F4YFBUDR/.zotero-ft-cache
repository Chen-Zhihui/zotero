3D face tracking & reconstruction
We provide solutions for state-of-the-art face tracking,  3D personal avatar creation and face re-enactment.
The 4dface SDK

Create 3D face avatars from a single image or from regular 2D video footage! The 4dface SDK enables you to seamlessly create a 3-dimensional face avatar, without any depth sensor or specialist hardware required. It can detect and track faces on images and videos using our 3D-based algorithms, learning how  your face looks like.

Use our technology to deliver tomorrow’s applications in health care, robotics, automotive safety, AR/VR, games and entertainment, marketing research, or whatever your domain might be.
