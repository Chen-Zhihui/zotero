Point distribution models

    The Point Distribution Model (PDM) is a powerful shape description technique that may subsequently be used in locating new instances of such shapes in other images.
    It is most useful for describing features that have well understood `general' shape, but which cannot be easily described by a rigid model.
    The PDM is a relatively recent development that has seen enormous application in a short time.

    The PDM approach assumes the existence of a set of M examples (a training set) from which to derive a statistical description of the shape and its variation.
    In our context, we take this to mean some number of instances of the shape represented by a boundary (a sequence of pixel co-ordinates).
    In addition, some number N of landmark points is selected on each boundary; these points are chosen to correspond to a feature of the underlying object.



    It is intuitively clear that if the hands so represented were in `about the same place', so would the N landmark points be.
    Variations in the positions of these points would then be attributable to natural variation between individuals.
    We may expect, though, that these differences would be `small' measured on the scale of the overall shape.
    The PDM approach allows us to model these `small' differences (and, indeed, to identify which are truly small, and which are more significant).

    Aligning the training data
    It is necessary first to align all the training shapes in an approximate sense.
    This is done by selecting for each example a suitable translation, scaling and rotation to ensure that they all correspond as closely as possible - informally, the transformations are chosen to reduce (in a least squares sense) the difference between an aligned shape and a `mean' shape derived from the whole set.
    Specifically, suppose we wish to align just two shapes - each of these is described by a vector of N co-ordinate pairs;


    A transform is composed of translation, rotation, and scaling represented by matrix R applied to x 2


    The best transform can be found by minimizing



    This minimization is a routine application of a least squares approach - partial derivatives of E are calculated with respect to the unknowns (theta, s, t x and t y ), and set to zero, leaving simultaneous linear equations to solve.

    This general idea is used to co-align all M shapes using the following algorithm;



    Step 3 of this algorithm is necessary since otherwise it is ill-conditioned (underconstrained); without doing this, convergence would not occur. Final convergence may be tested by examining the differences involved in realigning the shapes to the mean.

    This approach assumes that each of the landmark points is of equal significance, but that may not be the case. If for some reason one of them moves around the shape less than others, it has a desirable stability that we might wish to exploit during the alignment. This can be done by introducing a (diagonal) weight matrix W into equation 8.10



    The elements of W indicate the relative `stability' of each of the landmarks in which a high number indicates high stability (so counts for more in the error computation), and a low number the opposite.
    There are various ways of measuring this; one is to compute for each shape the distance between landmarks k and l, and to let V kl be the variance in these distances.
    A high variance would indicate high mobility, and so setting the weight for the k-th point to


    would have the desired weighting effect.

    Deriving the model
    The outcome of the alignment will be M (mutually aligned) boundaries


    Mean shape is given by

    where

    Knowledge of this mean allows explicit measurement of the variation and co-variation exhibited by each landmark and landmark pair; we can write


    Doing this for each training vector, we can calculate the 2N x 2N covariance matrix


    This matrix has some particularly useful properties.
    If we imagine the aligned training set plotted in 2N dimensions, it will exhibit variation more in some directions than others (these directions will not, of course, in general align with the co-ordinate axes) - these variations are important properties of the shape we are describing.
    What these directions are, and their (relative) importance, may be derived from an eigen-decomposition of S - that is, solving the equation



    Solutions to equation (8.12) provide the eigenvectors p i and eigenvalues lambda i of S; conventionally, we assume \lambda i >= \lambda i+1 .
    It can be shown that the eigenvectors associated with larger eigenvalues correspond to the directions of larger variation in the underlying data - they provide the modes of variation .
    Thus solving the equation and finding the highest eigenvalues tells us where the variation in the model is most likely to occur.

    It is well known that a set of eigenvectors provides a basis, meaning that we can represent any vector x as a linear combination of the 2N different p i . If we write


    then for any vector x, a vector b exists such that

    where the components of b indicate how much variation is exhibited with respect to each of the eigenvectors.

    Using the observation that the eigenvectors of lower index describe most of the changes in the training set, we may expect that the contributions from p 2N , p 2N+1 , ... will play a small role, thus



    and

    will be good for sufficiently high t

    This permits a dimensional compression of the representation - if there is a lot of structure in the data, t will be low (relative to 2N) and good shape description will be possible very compactly by representing the shape as b t rather than x.
    One approach to this is to calculate lambda total , the sum of the lambda i , and choose t such that


    The choice of alpha here will govern how much of the variation seen in the training set can be recaptured by the compacted model.

    Further, it can be shown that the variance of b i over the training set will be the associated lambda i ; accordingly, for `well behaved' shapes we might expect


    - that is, most of the population is within 3 sigma of the mean.

    This allows us to generate, from knowledge of P and lambda i , plausible shapes that are not part of the training set.

Example - Metacarpal analysis

    We can illustrate this theory with an example taken from automatic hand X-ray analysis.
    The finger bones (metacarpals) have characteristic long, thin shape with bulges near the ends - precise shape differs from individual to individual, and as an individual ages.
    Scrutiny of bone shape is of great value in diagnosing bone aging disorders and is widely used by pediatricians.

    From a collection of X-rays, 40 landmarks (so vectors are 80 dimensional) were picked out by hand on a number (approximately 50) of segmented metacarpals.
    Next figure illustrates (after alignment) the mean shape, together with the actual positions of the landmark points from the entire data set.





    The covariance matrix and its eigenvectors associated with the variation are extracted; the relative contribution of the most influential components is illustrated in Table~\ref{tab.PDM}.
    From this we see that more than 95% of the shape variation is captured by the first eight modes of variation.





    Next figure illustrates the effect of varying the first mode of the mean shape by up to 2.5 sqrt{lambda_1}.
    This mode, which accounts for more than 60% of the variation seen in the data, captures the (asymmetric) thickening and thining of bones (relative to their length) which is an obvious characteristic of maturity.
    In this example, it is clear that 2.5 is an unlikely factor for sqrt{lambda_1} since the resulting shapes are too extreme - thus we may expect b_1 to be smaller in magnitude for this application.





    Next figure similarly illustrates extremes of the third mode.
    The shape change here is somewhat subtler; part of what is captured is a bending (in banana fashion) of the bone.
    Both extremes have a plausible `bone-like' look about them.





Fitting models to data

    A strength of this approach is that it permits plausible shapes to be fitted to new data.
    Given an image in which we wish to locate an instance of a modelled shape (specifically, given an edge map of the image, so having information about where boundaries are most likely to lie), we require to know
        the mean shape x
        the transformation matrix P_t
        the particular shape parameter vector b_t
        the particular pose (translation, rotation, scale)

    The mean shape and the transformation matrix are known from the model construction
    The identification of b_t and the pose is an optimization problem
        locate the parameters that best fit the data at hand, subject to certain constraints.
        These constraints would include the known limits on reasonable values for the components of b_t, and might also include domain knowledge about plausible positions for the object to constrain the pose.
        In the metacarpal example, this would include knowledge that a bone lies within the hand silhouette, is aligned with the finger and is of a known approximate size.




    This approach may be used successfully with a number of well known optimization algorithms.
    It is likely, however, that convergence would be slow.
    An alternative, quicker approach is to use the PDM as the basis of an Active Shape Model (ASM).
    Here, we iterate toward the best fit by examining an approximate fit, locating improved positions for the landmark points, then recalculating pose and parameters.


Fitting an active shape model (ASM)






    Step 2 assumes that a suitable target can be found, which may not always be true.
    If there is none, the landmark can be left where it is, and the model constraints will eventually pull it into a reasonable position.
    There is also the option of locating targets by more sophisticated means than simple intensity gradient measurements.

    The algorithm is illustrated in the next figure.
    Note that the model locates the correct position despite the proximity of strong boundaries that could distract it - this does not occur because the shape of the boundary is tightly bound in.





Extensions

    In a short time, the literature on PDMs and ASMs has become very extensive - the technique lends itself to a very wide range of problems, but has some drawbacks.
    The placing of the landmark points for construction of the training set is clearly very labor intensive, and in some application error-prone.
    Automatic placing of these points has been addressed.

    Efficiency of the approach has also been enhanced by the common idea of a multi-resolution attack.

    Using a coarse-to-fine strategy can produce benefits in both quality of final fit, and reduction of computational load

    As presented, the approach is strictly linear in the sense that control points may only move along a straight line (albeit with respect to directions of maximum variation);
        non-linear effects are produced by combining contributions from different modes;
        aside from being imperfect, this results in a representation that is not as compact as it might be if the non-linear aspects were explicitly modeled.

    This problem has been addressed in two ways;
        introduction of the Polynomial Regression PDM which assumes dependence between the modes, with minor modes being polynomial combinations of major ones, and
        extension of the linear model by permitting polar relationships between modes, thereby efficiently capturing the ability of (parts of) objects to rotate around one another.
