SeetaFace Engine

License
Description

SeetaFace Engine is an open source C++ face recognition engine, which can run on CPU with no third-party dependence. It contains three key parts, i.e., SeetaFace Detection , SeetaFace Alignment and SeetaFace Identification , which are necessary and sufficient for building a real-world face recognition applicaiton system.

    SeetaFace Detection implements a funnel-structured (FuSt) cascade schema for real-time multi-view face detection, which achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and speed. State of the art accuracy can be achieved on the public dataset FDDB in high speed. See SeetaFace Detection for more details.

    SeetaFace Alignment cascades several stacked auto-encoder networks to detect landmarks in real time (more than 200 fps on a single I7 desktop CPU), and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy at least on some public datasets AFLW . See SeetaFace Alignment for more details.

    SeetaFace Identification is a modification of AlexNet CNN for face recognition, with better performance in terms of both accuracy (97.1% on [LFW] ( http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/ ) and speed (about 120ms on a single I7 desktop CPU). See SeetaFace Identification for more details.

This face recognition engine is developed by Visual Information Processing and Learning (VIPL) group, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The codes are written in C++ without dependence on any 3rd-party libraries. The open source is now released under BSD-2 license (see LICENSE for details), which means the codes can be used freely for both acedemic purpose and industrial products.

Setup
Prerequisites

    Linux or OSX
    rar(If you haven't installed it yet: sudo apt-get install rar)
    cmake-2.8.4 +
    OpenCV2(No need if you build without the example)

Make a choice

    Set option on in CMakeLists.txt to build with the example(Need OpenCV2).

    Set option off in CMakeLists.txt to build the shared library only(No need of OpenCV).

Getting Started

 cd SeetaFaceCool rar e model/model.part1.rar model/ mkdir build cd build cmake -D CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME=OFF .. make  

Then an executable file is generated in SeetaFaceCool/build/ and three shared libraries(.so) are generated in SeetaFaceCool/lib/

To run the seetaface_example:

 cd SeetaFaceCool ./build/seetaface_example Data/tangwei_gallery.jpg Data/tangwei_probe.jpg  

Modify the code in seetaface_example.cpp and re-execute the above process to realize your own function.
