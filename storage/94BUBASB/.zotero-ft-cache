Purpose

NodeEditor is conceived as a general-purpose Qt-based library aimed at graph-controlled data processing. Nodes represent algorithms with certain inputs and outputs. Connections transfer data from the output (source) of the first node to the input (sink) of the second one.

NodeEditor framework is a Visual Dataflow Programming tool. A library client defines models and registers them in the data model registry. Further work is driven by events taking place in DataModels and Nodes. The model computing is triggered upon arriving of any new input data. The computed result is propagated to the output connections. Each new connection fetches available data and propagates is further.

Each change in the source node is immediately propagated through all the connections updating the whole graph.
Platforms

    OSX (Apple Clang - LLVM 3.6), Linux (x64, gcc-5.0, clang-3.8): Build Status
    Windows (Win32, x64, msvc2015, MinGW 5.3): Build status

Dependencies

    CMake 3.2

Current state

    Model-based nodes
    Automatic data propagation
    Datatype-aware connections
    Embedded Qt widgets
    One-output to many-input connections
    JSON-based interface styles
    Saving scenes to JSON files

Roadmap

    Extend set of examples
    GUI: fix scrolling for scene view window scrolling
    Implement grouping nodes
    Split graph and GUI parts
    Build data propagation on top of the graph code
