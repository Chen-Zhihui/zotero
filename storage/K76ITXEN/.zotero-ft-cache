About: A Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Dynamically generates CPU and GPU modules for good performance. Deep Learning Tutorials illustrate deep learning with Theano.
Changes:
Theano 1.0.2 (23rd of May, 2018)

This is a maintenance release of Theano, version 1.0.2 , with no new features, but some important bug fixes.

We recommend that everybody update to this version.

Highlights (since 1.0.1):

    Theano should work under PyPy now (this is experimental).
    Update for cuDNN 7.1 RNN API changes.
    Fix for a crash related to mixed dtypes with cuDNN convolutions.
    MAGMA should work in more cases without manual config.
    Handle reductions with non-default accumulator dtype better on the GPU.
    Improvements to the test suite so that it fails less often due to random chance.

About: Deep measuring net sequence(DMNS) is a sequence of three deep measuring nets, the later are deep fcn-based networks, directely output object category score, object orientation, location and scale simultaneously without any anchor boxes. DMNS acheived high accuracy in maneuvering target detection and geometrical measurements. Its average orientation error is less than 3.5 degree, loaction error less than 1.3 pixel, scale measuring error less than 10%, achieve a detection F1-score 96.5% in OAD, 91.8% in SVDS ,90.8% in Munich , 87.3% in OIRDS, outperforms SSD, Fater R-CNN, etc.

Logo Aika 0.17

About: Aika is an open source text mining engine. It can automatically extract and annotate semantic information in text. In case this information is ambiguous, Aika will generate several hypothetical interpretations about the meaning of this text and retrieve the most likely one.
Changes:
Aika Version 0.17 2018-05-14

    Introduction of synapse relations. Previously the relation between synapses was implicitly modeled through word positions (RIDs). Now it is possible to explicitly model relations like: The end position of input activation 1 equals to the begin position of input activation 2. Two types of relations are currently supported, range relations and instance relations. Range relations compare the input activation range of a given synapse with that of the linked synapse. Instance relations also compare the input activations of two synapses, but instead of the ranges the dependency relations of these activations are compared.
    Removed the norm term from the interpretation objective function.
    Introduction of an optional distance function to synapses. It allows to model a weakening signal depending on the distance of the activation ranges.
    Example implementation of a context free grammar.
    Example implementation for co-reference resolution.
    Work on an syllable identification experiment based on the meta network implementation.

Aika Version 0.15 2018-03-16

    Simplified interpretation handling by removing the InterpretationNode class and moving the remaining logic to the Activation class.
    Moved the activation linking and activation selection code to separate classes.
    Ongoing work on the training algorithms.
