OpenFace 0.4.1: an open source facial behavior analysis toolkit

Build Status Build status

Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in automatic facial behavior analysis and understanding. We present OpenFace – a tool intended for computer vision and machine learning researchers, affective computing community and people interested in building interactive applications based on facial behavior analysis. OpenFace is the ﬁrst toolkit capable of facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, facial action unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation with available source code. The computer vision algorithms which represent the core of OpenFace demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all of the above mentioned tasks. Furthermore, our tool is capable of real-time performance and is able to run from a simple webcam without any specialist hardware.

OpenFace is an implementation of a number of research papers from the Multicomp group, Language Technologies Institute at the Carnegie Mellon University and Rainbow Group, Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge. The founder of the project and main developer is Tadas Baltrušaitis.

Special thanks goes to Louis-Philippe Morency and his MultiComp Lab at Carnegie Mellon University for help in writing and testing the code, and Erroll Wood for the gaze estimation work.

Final remarks

I did my best to make sure that the code runs out of the box but there are always issues and I would be grateful for your understanding that this is research code and not full fledged product. However, if you encounter any problems/bugs/issues please contact me on github or by emailing me at Tadas.Baltrusaitis@cl.cam.ac.uk for any bug reports/questions/suggestions. I prefer questions and bug reports on github as that provides visibility to others who might be encountering same issues or who have the same questions.
