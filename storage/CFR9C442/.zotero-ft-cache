The provided widgets are:

    ColorWheel, An analog widget used to select a color
    ColorPreview, A simple widget that displays a color
    GradientSlider, A slider that has a gradient background
    HueSlider, A variant of GradientSlider that has a rainbow background
    ColorSelector, A ColorPreview that shows a ColorDialog when clicked
    ColorDialog, A dialog that uses the above widgets to provide a better user experience than QColorDialog
    ColorListWidget, A widget to edit a list of colors
    Swatch, A widget to display a color palette
    ColorPaletteWidget, A widget to use and manage a list of palettes
    Color2DSlider, An analog widget used to select 2 color components
    ColorLineEdit, A widget to manipulate a string representing a color

they are all in the color_widgets namespace.

See the gallery for more information and screenshots.
Using it in a project

For QMake-based projects, include color_widgets.pri in the QMake project file. For CMake-based projects, add this as subdirectory, it will be compiled as a library and you can link the required targets to ColorWidgets. All the required files are in ./src and ./include.
Installing as a Qt Designer/Creator Plugin

The sources for the designer plugin are in ./color_widgets_designer_plugin

Compile the library and install in (Qt SDK)/Tools/QtCreator/bin/designer/ (Qt SDK)/(Qt Version)/(Toolchain)/plugins/designer

cd build && cmake .. && make ColorWidgetsPlugin && make install
Latest Version

The latest version of the sources can be found at the following locations:

    https://gitlab.com/mattia.basaglia/Qt-Color-Widgets
    git://gitlab.com/mattia.basaglia/Qt-Color-Widgets.git
