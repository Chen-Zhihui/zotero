Linux Packages

We provide binary packages for several Linux distributions using the openSUSE Build Service . Please follow the linked installation guides below or alternatively visit our OBS project homepage: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:libraries:caf/caf
package 	description 	link
caf 	binaries only 	stable nightly
caf-devel 	binaries and headers 	stable nightly
FreeBSD Ports

We maintain a port for CAF, which you can install as follows:

 pkg install caf

Alternatively, you can go to /usr/ports/devel/caf and tweak a few configuration options before installing the port:

 make config
make install clean

Homebrew

You can install the latest stable release with:

 brew install caf

Alternatively, you can use the current development version by using:

 brew install caf --HEAD

Get the Sources

    git clone https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework.git
    cd actor-framework

Build CAF from Source

The easiest way to build CAF is to use the configure script. Other available options are using CMake directly or SNocs .
Using the configure Script

The script is a convenient frontend for CMake . See configure -h for a list of available options or read the [online documentation] ( https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/wiki/Configure-Options ).

 ./configure
make
make test 
make install [as root, optional]

Using CMake

All available CMake variables are available online . CAF also can be included as CMake submodule or added as dependency to other CMake-based projects using the file cmake/FindCAF.cmake .
Using SNocs

A SNocs workspace is provided by GitHub user osblinnikov and documented online .
Dependencies

    CMake
    Pthread (until C++11 compilers support the new thread_local keyword)

Supported Compilers

    GCC >= 4.8
    Clang >= 3.2
    MSVC >= 2015, update 3

Supported Operating Systems
