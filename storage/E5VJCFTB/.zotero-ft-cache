A video file format is a type of file format for storing digital video data on a computer system. Video is almost always stored in compressed form to reduce the file size.

A video file normally consists of a container (e.g. in the Matroska format) containing video data in a video coding format (e.g. VP9 ) alongside audio data in an audio coding format (e.g. Opus ). The container can also contain synchronization information, subtitles, and metadata such as title. A standardized (or in some cases de facto standard ) video file type such as .webm is a profile specified by a restriction on which container format and which video and audio compression formats are allowed.

The coded video and audio inside a video file container (i.e. not headers, footers and metadata) is called the essence . A program (or hardware) which can decode video or audio is called a codec ; playing or encoding a video file will sometimes require the user to install a codec library corresponding to the type of video and audio coding used in the file.

Good design normally dictates that a file extension enables the user to derive which program will open the file from the file extension. That is the case with some video file formats, such as WebM (.webm), Windows Media Video (.wmv), and Ogg Video (.ogv), each of which can only contain a few well-defined subtypes of video and audio coding formats, making it relatively easy to know which codec will play the file. In contrast to that, some very general-purpose container types like AVI (.avi) and QuickTime (.mov) can contain video and audio in almost any format, and have file extensions named after the container type, making it very hard for the end user to use the file extension to derive which codec or program to use to play the files.

The free software FFmpeg project's libraries have very wide support for encoding and decoding video file formats. For example, Google uses ffmpeg to support a wide range of upload video formats for YouTube. [1] One widely used media player using the ffmpeg libraries is the free software VLC media player , which can play most video files that end users will encounter.
List of video file formats [ edit ]
Name 	File extension(s) 	Container format 	Video coding format(s) 	Audio coding format(s) 	Notes
WebM 	.webm 	Matroska 	VP8 , VP9 	Vorbis , Opus 	Royalty-free format created for HTML5 video .
Matroska 	.mkv 	Matroska 	Any 	Any 	
Flash Video (FLV) 	.flv 	FLV 	VP6 , Sorenson Spark , Screen video, Screen video 2, H.264 	MP3 , ADPCM , Nellymoser , Speex , AAC 	Use of the H.264 and AAC compression formats in the FLV file format has some limitations and authors of Flash Player strongly encourage everyone to embrace the new standard F4V file format [2] de facto standard for web-based streaming video (over RTMP ).
F4V 	.flv 	MPEG-4 Part 12 	H.264 	MP3 , AAC 	Replacement for FLV.
Vob 	.vob 	VOB 	H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 or MPEG-1 Part 2 	PCM , DTS , MPEG-1 , Audio Layer II (MP2), or Dolby Digital (AC-3) 	Files in VOB format have .vob filename extension and are typically stored in the VIDEO_TS folder at the root of a DVD . The VOB format is based on the MPEG program stream format.
Ogg Video 	.ogv, .ogg 	Ogg 	Theora , Dirac 	Vorbis , FLAC 	
Dirac 	.drc 	? 	Dirac 	? 	
GIF 	.gif 	N/A 	N/A 	none 	Simple animation, inefficient compression, no sound, widely supported
Video alternative to GIF 	.gifv 	HTML 	Any 	none 	Not standardized, and not a real video file in the classical meaning since it merely references the real video file (e.g. a .webm file), which has to exist separately elsewhere. A .gifv "file" is simply a HTML webpage which includes a HTML5 video tag, where the video has no sound. As there were large communities online which create art using the medium of short soundless videos in GIF format, GIFV was created as a functionally similar replacement with vastly smaller filesizes than the inefficient GIF format.
Multiple-image Network Graphics 	.mng 	N/A 	N/A 	none 	Inefficient, not widely used.
AVI 	.avi 	AVI 	any 	any 	Uses RIFF
QuickTime File Format 	.mov, .qt 	QuickTime 	Many [3] 	AAC , MP3 , others [3] 	
Windows Media Video 	.wmv 	ASF 	Windows Media Video, Windows Media Video Screen, Windows Media Video Image 	Windows Media Audio, Sipro ACELP.net 	
Raw video format 	.yuv 	Further documentation needed 	Doesn't apply 	Doesn't apply 	Supports all resolutions, sampling structures, and frame rates
RealMedia (RM) 	.rm 	RealMedia 	RealVideo 	RealAudio 	Made for RealPlayer
RealMedia Variable Bitrate (RMVB) 	.rmvb 	RealMedia Variable Bitrate 	RealVideo 	RealAudio 	Made for RealPlayer
Advanced Systems Format (ASF) 	.asf 	ASF 	any 	any 	
AMV video format 	.amv 	Modified version of AVI [4] 	Variant of Motion JPEG 	Variant of IMA , ADPCM 	Proprietary video file format produced for MP4 players and S1 MP3 players with video playback
MPEG-4 Part 14 (MP4) 	.mp4, .m4p (with DRM), .m4v 	MPEG-4 Part 12 	H.264 , MPEG-4 Part 2 , MPEG-2 , MPEG-1 	Advanced Audio Coding , MP3 , others 	
MPEG-1 	.mpg, .mp2, .mpeg, .mpe, .mpv 	MPEG-1 part 1 	MPEG-1 part 2 	MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, MPEG-1 Audio Layer III ( MP3 ) 	Old, but very widely used due to installed base.
MPEG-2  – Video 	.mpg, .mpeg, .m2v 	? 	H.262 	AAC , MP3 , MPEG-2 Part 3 , others 	
M4V  – (file format for videos for iPods and PlayStation Portables developed by Apple) 	.m4v 	MPEG-4 Part 12 	H.264 	AAC , Dolby Digital 	Developed by Apple, used in iTunes. Very similar to MP4 format, but may optionally have DRM.
SVI 	.svi 	? 	? 	? 	Samsung video format for portable players
3GPP 	.3gp 	MPEG-4 Part 12 	MPEG-4 Part 2 , H.263 , H.264 	AMR-NB , AMR-WB , AMR-WB+ , AAC-LC , HE-AAC v1 or Enhanced aacPlus (HE-AAC v2) 	Common video format for cell phones
3GPP2 	.3g2 	MPEG-4 Part 12 	MPEG-4 Part 2 , H.263 , H.264 	AMR-NB , AMR-WB , AMR-WB+ , AAC-LC , HE-AAC v1 or Enhanced aacPlus (HE-AAC v2), EVRC , SMV or VMR-WB 	Common video format for cell phones
Material Exchange Format (MXF) 	.mxf 	MXF 	? 	? 	
ROQ 	.roq 	? 	? 	? 	used by Quake 3 [5]
Nullsoft Streaming Video (NSV) 	.nsv 	NSV 	? 	? 	For streaming video content over the Internet
Flash Video (FLV) 	.flv .f4v .f4p .f4a .f4b 	Audio, video, text, data 	Adobe Flash Platform 	SWF, F4V, ISO base media file format 	Developed by the Adobe Flash Platform
