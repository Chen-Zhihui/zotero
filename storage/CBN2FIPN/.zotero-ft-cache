Awesome asyncio Awesome

    A carefully curated list of awesome Python asyncio frameworks, libraries, software and resources.

The Python asyncio module introduced to the standard library with Python 3.4 provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.

Asyncio is not really a brand-new technology however it appears to be very trending since a few years - especially in the Python community and with the release of Python 3.4 in March 2016. Thus, it's pretty hard to keep yourself up-to-date with the most awesome packages out there. Find some of those awesome packages here and if you are missing one we count on you to create an Issue or a Pull Request with your suggestion.
