DataStax C/C++ Driver for Apache Cassandra

Build Status: Linux Build Status: Windows

A modern, feature-rich] and highly tunable C/C++ client library for Apache Cassandra 2.1+ using exclusively Cassandra's binary protocol and Cassandra Query Language v3. Use the DSE C/C++ driver for better compatibility and support for DataStax Enterprise .
Getting the Driver

Binary versions of the driver, available for multiple operating systems and multiple architectures, can be obtained from our download server . The source code is made available via GitHub . If using DataStax Enterprise use the DSE C/C++ driver instead .

Packages for the driver's dependencies, libuv (1.x) and OpenSSL, are also provided under the dependencies directory for each platform (if applicable). Note : CentOS and Ubuntu use the version of OpenSSL provided with the distribution:

    CentOS 6
    CentOS 7
    Ubuntu 14.04
    Ubuntu 16.04
    Windows

Note : DataStax products do not support big-endian systems.
What's New in 2.5/2.6

    Support for duration
    Speculative execution
    Idempotent statements
    SSL can be enabled without re-initializing the underlying library (e.g. OpenSSL)

More information about features included in 2.3 can be found in this blog post .
Upgrading from 2.0 or 2.1 to 2.2+

The new schema metadata API in 2.2 required some breaking API changes. Applications that used the previous schema metadata API from 2.0 and 2.1 will require some small modifications to use the new API. More information about the new schema metadata API can be found in this blog post .
Upgrading from 1.0 to 2.0+

There were a couple breaking API changes between 1.0 and 2.0 that are documented here .
Features

    Asynchronous API
    Simple , Prepared , and Batch statements
    Asynchronous I/O , parallel execution , and request pipelining
    Connection pooling
    Automatic node discovery
    Automatic reconnection
    Configurable load balancing
    Works with any cluster size
    Authentication
    SSL
    Latency-aware routing
    Performance metrics
    Tuples and UDTs
    Nested collections
    Retry policies
    Client-side timestamps
    Data types
    Idle connection heartbeats
    Support for materialized view and secondary index metadata
    Support for clustering key order, frozen<> and Cassandra version metadata
    Blacklist , whitelist DC , and blacklist DC load balancing policies
    Custom authenticators
    Reverse DNS with SSL peer identity verification support
    Randomized contact points

Compatibility

This driver works exclusively with the Cassandra Query Language v3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's native protocol. The current version works with:

    Apache Cassandra versions 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0+
    Architectures: 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64)
    Compilers: GCC 4.1.2+, Clang 3.4+, and MSVC 2010/2012/2013/2015/2017

If using DataStax Enterprise the DSE C/C++ driver provides more features and better compatibility. A complete compatibility matrix for both Apache Cassandra and DataStax Enterprise can be found here .

Feedback Requested

Help us focus our efforts! Provide your input on the C/C++ Driver Platform and Runtime Survey (we kept it short).
Examples

The driver includes several examples in the examples directory.
A Simple Example

 # include  < cassandra.h >  
# include  < stdio.h >  

int  main ( int  argc, char * argv[]) {
  /* Setup and connect to cluster */  
  CassFuture* connect_future = NULL ;
  CassCluster* cluster = cass_cluster_new ();
  CassSession* session = cass_session_new ();
  char * hosts = " 127.0.0.1 "  ;
  if  (argc > 1 ) {
    hosts = argv[ 1 ];
  }

  /* Add contact points */  
  cass_cluster_set_contact_points (cluster, hosts);

  /* Provide the cluster object as configuration to connect the session */  
  connect_future = cass_session_connect (session, cluster);

  if  ( cass_future_error_code (connect_future) == CASS_OK) {
    CassFuture* close_future = NULL ;

    /* Build statement and execute query */  
    const  char * query = " SELECT release_version FROM system.local "  ;
    CassStatement* statement = cass_statement_new (query, 0 );

    CassFuture* result_future = cass_session_execute (session, statement);

    if  ( cass_future_error_code (result_future) == CASS_OK) {
      /* Retrieve result set and get the first row */  
      const  CassResult* result = cass_future_get_result (result_future);
      const  CassRow* row = cass_result_first_row (result);

      if  (row) {
        const  CassValue* value = cass_row_get_column_by_name (row, " release_version "  );

        const  char * release_version;
        size_t  release_version_length;
        cass_value_get_string (value, &release_version, &release_version_length);
        printf ( " release_version: ' %.*s ' \n "  , ( int )release_version_length, release_version);
      }

      cass_result_free (result);
    } else  {
      /* Handle error */  
      const  char * message;
      size_t  message_length;
      cass_future_error_message (result_future, &message, &message_length);
      fprintf (stderr, " Unable to run query: ' %.*s ' \n "  , ( int )message_length, message);
    }

    cass_statement_free (statement);
    cass_future_free (result_future);

    /* Close the session */  
    close_future = cass_session_close (session);
    cass_future_wait (close_future);
    cass_future_free (close_future);
  } else  {
    /* Handle error */  
    const  char * message;
    size_t  message_length;
    cass_future_error_message (connect_future, &message, &message_length);
    fprintf (stderr, " Unable to connect: ' %.*s ' \n "  , ( int )message_length, message);
  }

  cass_future_free (connect_future);
  cass_cluster_free (cluster);
  cass_session_free (session);

  return  0 ;
}
