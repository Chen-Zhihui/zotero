Deep Video Analytics     Build Status Build Status
by Akshay Bhat, Cornell University.

UI Screenshot

Deep Video Analytics is a platform for indexing and extracting information from videos and images. With latest version of docker installed correctly, you can run Deep Video Analytics in minutes locally (even without a GPU) using a single command.
For installation instructions & demo please visit https://www.deepvideoanalytics.com
Documentation & tutorial

    For a quick overview we strongly recommend going through the presentation in readme.pdf

    Documentation along with a tutorial is being written in /docs/tutorial directory.

Experiments

    OCR example has been moved to /docs/experiments/ocr directory .
    More experiments coming soon!

Deployment

We provide instructions for deploying DVA in three scenarios.

    deploy/cpu contains docker-compose files for non-GPU single machine deployments on Linode, AWS, GCP etc.

    deploy/gpu contains docker-compose files for GPU single machine deployments on GCP, AWS etc.

    deploy/kube contains files used for launching DVA in a scalable GKE + GCS setup, with and without GPUs.

Development

    deploy/dev contains docker-compose files for interactively developing DVA by using host server directory mapped as a volume.

Code organization

    /client : Python client using DVA REST API
    /configs : ngnix config + defaults.py defining models + processing pipelines (can be replaced by mounting a volume)
    /deploy : Dockerfiles + Instructions for development, single machine deployment and scalable deployment with Kubernetes
    /docs : Documentation, tutorial and experiments
    /tests : Files required for testing
    /repos : Code copied from third party repos, e.g. Yahoo LOPQ, TF-CTPN etc.
    /server : dvalib + django server contains contains bulk of the code for UI, App and models.
    /logs : Empty dir for storing logs
