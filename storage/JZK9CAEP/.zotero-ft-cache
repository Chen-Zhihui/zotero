Pedis (Parallel Redis)
What's Pedis?

Pedis is the NoSQL data store using the SEASTAR framework, compatible with REDIS. The name of Pedis is an acronym of P arallel r edis , which with high throughput and low latency.

Redis is very popular data structures server. For more infomation, see here: http://redis.io/ Seastar is an advanced, open-source C++ framework for high-performance server applications on modern hardware. For more infomation, see here: http://www.seastar-project.org/

Now, the redis commands were supported by Pedis as follow:

    KEY : DEL, EXISTS, TTL, PTTL, EXPIRE, PEXPIRE
    STRING : GET, SET, DECR, INCR, DECRBY, INCRBY, APPEND, STRLEN, MGET, MSET
    LIST : LINDEX, LINSERT, LLEN, LPUSH, LPUSHX, LPOP, LRANGE, LREM, LTRIM, LSET, RPOP, RPUSH, RPUSHX
    HASH : HSET, HDEL, HGET, HLEN, HSTRLEN, HMSET, HMGET, HKEYS, HVALS, HEXISTS, HINCRBY
    SET : SADD, SMEMBERS, SISMEMBER, SREM, SDIFF, SDIFFSTORE, SINTER, SINTERSTORE, SUNION, SUNIONSTORE, SMOVE, SPOP
    SORTED SET : ZADD, ZCARD, ZCOUNT, ZINCRBY, ZRANGE, ZRANK, ZREM, ZREMRANGEBYSCORE, ZREMRANGEBYRANK, ZREVRANGE, ZREVRANGEBYSCORE, ZREVRANK, ZSCORE, ZUNIONSTORE, ZINTERSTORE
    GEO : GEOADD, GEOPOS, GEOHASH, GEODIST, GEORADIUS, GEORADIUSMEMBER
    HyperLogLog : PFADD, PFCOUNT, PFMERGE
    OTHER : ECHO, PING, SELECT

Building Pedis

In fact, the building instructions of Seastar also works for Pedis.

See building instructions for Fedora , CentOS and Ubuntu .
Getting started

 ./build/release/pedis --c 1 -m 1G  

Current Roadmap

We will build the next generation of redis cluster.
Short-term

    Implement the redis commands.
    Output the necessary metrics.

Long-term

    Build the redis cluster, using GOSSIP protocol to broadcast redis node's status.
    Build the data replication mechanism between redis cluster.
    Persist the data to disk based on Structured-logs-merged tree.

Benchmark

The following describe the details of the Pedis benchmark making it reproducible. The result data was generated by memtier_benchmark( https://github.com/RedisLabs/memtier_benchmark ).

Latest Results(Sep. 2016)

Pedis's latency was less then 0.5ms for 99% of all requests.

Test bed:

    Server 1: Pedis/Redis Server
    Server 2: memtier_benchmark tool

Software:

    OS RedHat EL7
    Pedis (latest)
    Redis (2.8)

Hardware:

    Memory: 128GB
    SSD: 500GB
    CPU: 24 logical cores
    NIC: 1000Mb
