real_time_face_detection and recognition

This is a real time face detection and recognition project base on opencv/tensorflow/mtcnn/facenet. Chinese version of description is here .Face detection is based on MTCNN .Face embedding is based on Facenet . ##Workflow

##Inspiration The code was inspired by several projects as follows:

1. OpenFace . The main idea was inspired by openface. However, I prefer python and tensorflow,so there comes this project.

2. davidsandberg/facenet .

facenet.py was taken from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/facenet/src/facenet.py

nn4.py was taken from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/src/models/nn4.py

detect_face.py was taken from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/src/align/detect_face.py

3. yobibyte/yobiface .

##Dependencies 1.tensorflow 2.opencv with python bindings (cv2) 3.jupyter notebook for running .ipynb examples

##Running 1.Downloading pre-trained facenet from https://github.com/yobibyte/yobiface/blob/master/model/model-20160506.ckpt-500000 and putting in model_check_point folder.

2.Running real time face detection and recognition.ipynb with jupyter notebook
