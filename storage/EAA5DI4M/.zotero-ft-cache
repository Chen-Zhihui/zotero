What is chigraph?

Chigraph, pronunced chai-graph, is a new systems programming language. It's fast. It's scalable. And, more importantly, it's easy to learn. How does it achieve such goals? By scrapping the age-old standard of text (not entirely though). Here's a screenshot from the Qt5 GUI :

    NOTE This is the repository for the chigraph language. If you are looking for the interface that goes along with it, see https://github.com/chigraph/chigraph-gui

Components

Chigraph is made up of three components:
chi

chi is the command line interface to chigraph. It lets you compile and run chigraph modules:

 $ pwd 
~ /chigrpah/src/
$ chi get github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph/hello/main # download it 
$ cd  github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph/hello/main
$ chi run main.chimod # run it 
Hello World ! 

libchigraph

libchigraph is the chigraph library that provides all functions for chigraph clients, like code generation, graph representation, etc. Want to compile a chigraph module using libchigraph? ( documentation )

 # include  < chi/Context.hpp >  

int  main () {
    chi::Contxt myContext{ " /path/to/workspace "  };

    // download and load the module 
    myContxt. loadModule ( " github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph/hello/main "  , chi::LoadOptions::FetchDependencies);

    // compile it 
    llvm::Module* mod;
    myContxt. compileModule ( " github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph "  , &mod);
}

And tada, you have yourself a llvm::Module to do whatever you wish to. It'll have all it's dependencies linked in and a main function waiting to run.
libchigraphdebugger

libchigraphdebugger is a library that makes it easy to implement chigraph debuggers. See the Debugger documentation for more details.
Licensing

It's free! Chigraph is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 so anyone can use it for free, even in proprietary settings (solong you attribute me)
API Documentation

API Documentation (generated by doxygen ) can be found here .
