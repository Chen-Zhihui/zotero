Microsoft Face API: Python SDK & Sample

This repo contains the Python SDK for the Microsoft Face API, an offering within Microsoft Cognitive Services , formerly known as Project Oxford.

    Learn about the Face API
    Documentation & API Reference & SDKs

Getting started

Install the module using pip :

 pip install cognitive_face

Use it:

 import  cognitive_face as  CF 

KEY  =  ' subscription key '    # Replace with a valid Subscription Key here. 
CF .Key.set( KEY )

BASE_URL  =  ' https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0/ '    # Replace with your regional Base URL 
CF .BaseUrl.set( BASE_URL )

img_url =  ' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Windows/master/Data/detection1.jpg '  
result =  CF .face.detect(img_url)
print  result

Installing from the source code

 python setup.py install

Running the unit tests

To run the tests you will need a valid subscription. You can get one here .

    Copy cognitive_face/tests/config.sample.py into cognitive_face/tests/config.py .
    Change the KEY and BASE_URL parameters to your own subscription's API key and endpoint.
    Run the following:

 python setup.py test 

Running the sample

A sample desktop application is also provided.

Currently it support the following combination of prerequisites:

    Python 3 + wxPython 4 [Recommended]
    Python 2 + wxPython 4
    Python 2 + wxPython 3

P.S. WxPython 3 does not support Python 3 by design.

Then run the following:

 git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Python.git
cd  Cognitive-Face-Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sample
