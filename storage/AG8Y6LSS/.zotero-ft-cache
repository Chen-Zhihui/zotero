Deep Learning Papers Reading Roadmap

    If you are a newcomer to the Deep Learning area, the first question you may have is "Which paper should I start reading from?"

    Here is a reading roadmap of Deep Learning papers!

The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following four guidelines:

    From outline to detail
    From old to state-of-the-art
    from generic to specific areas
    focus on state-of-the-art

You will find many papers that are quite new but really worth reading.

I would continue adding papers to this roadmap.
