Image Watch plugin for Visual Studio

Nov 14, 2014
Image Watch tooltip dialog for Mat variable

Dear OpenCV users,

Last year my team at Microsoft Research released Image Watch, a Visual Studio extension that lets you view in-memory images while debugging OpenCV applications.

Unfortunately, the free “Express” editions of Visual Studio did not support Visual Studio extensions such as Image Watch.

Today we are happy to report that Microsoft released a new free edition of Visual Studio called “Community” which does support extensibility.

This means that now you can use Image Watch and other plug-ins with your free version of Visual Studio!

Best regards,
Wolf Kienzle
Microsoft Research
