The world has a connectivity issue
In many places internet can be slow, unreliable or even censored. Kiwix is an offline solution that allows you to access educational content like Wikipedia, the Wiktionary, TED talks and many others on any computer or smartphone - without the need for a live internet connection.
We bring internet content
to people without internet access
In schools, universities, prisons, and of course at home. Locally-stored content saves bandwidth and download time. Kiwix is small and efficient, works on low power or old computers. It also runs on a wide range of operating systems, from Android and iOS to Microsoft Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux distributions.

There is more than a million of them every year.
