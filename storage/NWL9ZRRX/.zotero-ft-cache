README.md
Face classification and detection from the B-IT-BOTS robotics team .

Real-time face detection and emotion/gender classification using fer2013/IMDB datasets with a keras CNN model and openCV.

    IMDB gender classification test accuracy: 96%.
    fer2013 emotion classification test accuracy: 66%.

For more information please consult the publication
Emotion/gender examples:

Guided back-prop alt tag

Real-time demo:

B-IT-BOTS robotics team :) alt tag
Instructions
Run real-time emotion demo:

    python3 video_emotion_color_demo.py

Run real-time guided back-prop demo:

    python3 image_gradcam_demo.py

Make inference on single images:

    python3 image_emotion_gender_demo.py <image_path>

e.g.

    python3 image_emotion_gender_demo.py ../images/test_image.jpg

Running with Docker

With a few steps one can get its own face classification and detection running. Follow the commands below:

    docker pull ekholabs/face-classifier
    docker run -d -p 8084:8084 --name=face-classifier ekholabs/face-classifier
    curl -v -F image=@[path_to_image] http://localhost:8084/classifyImage > image.png

To train previous/new models for emotion classification:

    Download the fer2013.tar.gz file from here

    Move the downloaded file to the datasets directory inside this repository.

    Untar the file:

    tar -xzf fer2013.tar

    Run the train_emotion_classification.py file

    python3 train_emotion_classifier.py

To train previous/new models for gender classification:

    Download the imdb_crop.tar file from here (It's the 7GB button with the tittle Download faces only).

    Move the downloaded file to the datasets directory inside this repository.

    Untar the file:

    tar -xfv imdb_crop.tar

    Run the train_gender_classification.py file

    python3 train_gender_classifier.py
