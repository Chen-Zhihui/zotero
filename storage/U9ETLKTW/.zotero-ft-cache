About Ingex
Ingex is a branded technology from BBC Research & Development It is a suite of open source software applications designed for low-cost flexible tapeless recording in:

    TV Production, and
    Archiving Facilites

Features
Ingex modernises media workflows and enables you to:

    Record, encode and log feeds with metadata
    Playback and share assets immediately with post production
    Digitise and archive tapes

Benefits

    Cost Savings: lower capex, no tapes, removes digitisation
    Creative Dividends: instant playback for reassurance, remote viewing of rushes, logs of cue points and comments being carried through to the edit

Availability
The technology is now available to the industry in a variety of ways:

    Open Source ie without charge, under terms of the GPL software licence
    Under License ie to businesses developing their own commercial propositions for their customers
    Commercially ie direct to end users through established service providers

Software
The source code for the Ingex software can be accessed via anonymous CVS or can be browsed online directly from the CVS repository .

The software consists of the following components:

    Ingex Studio - a multi-camera television studio ingest and transcoding system.
    SD codecs:
        Avid-compatible JPEG codec resolutions known as 2:1, 3:1, 10:1, 20:1, 15:1s, 10:1m
        DVCPRO50 (50Mbps) and DV (25Mbps)
        IMX 50/40/30 (50/40/30Mbps)
        Uncompressed SD video at 8 bits-per-sample
    HD codecs:
        VC-3 at 120Mbps and 185Mbps
        DVCPRO HD
        Uncompressed HD video at 8 bits-per-sample
    Ingex Player - software player for playback of MXF OP-Atom and MXF OP-1a files. Supports playout to computer monitor or over SDI I/O card. Features include quad-split, audio monitor, timecode display and jog-shuttle control.
    Ingex Archive - ingest system designed for video tape archive preservation. Video tape is played back from a VTR, ingested over SDI, and stored as an MXF OP-1a file, including all audio channels, VITC and LTC timecodes and archive database metadata. Features include VTR-control, D-3 tape error recording, PSE analysis and MPEG-2 browse generation.
    MediaHarmony - a Samba VFS module which allows multiple Avid editing workstations to use low-cost commodity storage without conflicts around the .pmr and .mdb database files. This is particularly useful for workgroups of editors using Avid XpressDV.
    libMXF - a low-level C library for reading and writing MXF files. Particular attention has been made to creating MXF files compatible with Avid software and P2 cameras. Several useful command line tools are included.

Other tools include:

    TransferToP2 - Re-wrap Avid MXF (OP-Atom) files into P2 compatible MXF files
    Re-wrap EVS JPEG coded "MXF" files into Avid-compatible MXF
    Re-wrap P2 MXF (OP-Atom) files into Avid-compatible MXF for older versions of Avid software which do not support P2 MXF files

Track Record
Ingex is used by flagship BBC shows such as EastEnders and Dragons' Den, and was used in the children's show BAMZOOKi in 2005 (8 minute video 63 MB).
