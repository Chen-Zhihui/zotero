ImageNet Designer

ImageNets is an open source and platform independent (Windows & Linux) framework for rapid prototyping of Machine Vision algorithms. With the GUI ImageNet Designer , no programming knowledge is required to perform operations on images. A configured ImageNet can be loaded and executed from C++ code without the need for loading the ImageNet Designer GUI to achieve higher execution performance. Originally, ImageNets was developed for the Care-Providing Robot FRIEND [1] [2] but it can be used for a wide range of computer vision applications.

ImageNets was developed by the Institute of Automation, University of Bremen , Germany. The software was first publicly released in 2010.
