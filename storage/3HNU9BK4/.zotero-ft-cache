README.md

Created in a week as part of my application to work at reddit. QTPy is a machine-learning strategist and the first Quantum Tic-tac-toe playing bot. Now it's GPL'd.
Install

You'll first need to install the python-webpy, python-sqlalchemy and python-elixir packages. In addition, you will need to set up a database supported by SQLAlchemy.

Next, create a YAML config file that points to the database you created:

 echo "db: postgres://qtpy@localhost/qtpy" > config.yaml  

Now you'll have to create the tables. Don't worry; it's easy. Hack this into a terminal from inside the application directory:

 $ python >>> import yaml, elixir, botmoves, botmovesmapped >>> elixir.metadata.bind = yaml.load(file('config.yaml', 'r'))['db'] >>> elixir.setup_all() >>> elixir.create_all()  

If it seems like nothing happened, it succeeded.

Now you should be ready to serve it up:

 $ python qtpy.py config.yaml  

Go to http://localhost:8080 and play.
YAML Configuration

db: The connection URL to the moves database. Required.

host: Hostname to bind to. Defaults to 0.0.0.0.

port: Port num to bind to. Defaults to 8080.

debug: Print debug info on server error. Defaults to true.
