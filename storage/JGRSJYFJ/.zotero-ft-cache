Triplet loss for Caffe

Introduce triplet loss layer to caffe.
Concretely, we use cosine matric to constrain the distance between samples among same label/different labels.
Useage

1st, you need create a ordered file list for training.
This file list control the exactly data read-in order during training phase. Suppose in each mini-batch, you have data from 4 labels and 2 samples in each label, then the content of the file list should be like this:

 img_path_1_from_label_1 label_1 img_path_2_from_label_1 label_1 img_path_1_from_label_2 label_2 img_path_2_from_label_2 label_2 ... img_path_1_from_label_4 label_4 img_path_2_from_label_4 label_4  

2nd, define network structure in your train_val.prototxt.
Setup SampleTripletLayer to sample triplets in each mini-batch. Currently, triplets are made up by all anchor-positive pairs in the sample label and one hardest negative sample from other labels.

 layer { name: "sample_triplet" type: "SampleTriplet" bottom: "fully_connected_feature" top: "triplet" sample_triplet_param { label_num: 4 sample_num: 2 } }  

Setup TripletLossLayer to calculate loss.

 layer { name: "triplet_loss" type: "TripletLoss" bottom: "fully_connected_feature" bottom: "triplet" top: "triplet_loss" triplet_loss_param { margin: 0.1 } loss_weight: 1 }
