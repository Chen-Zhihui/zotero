sqlpp11-connector-stl

An experimental SQL connector for containers and streams of the C++ Standard Library
Motivation:

Well, sqlpp11 has this wonderful expression tree. It makes it really easy to connect to databases. And you know what? You can even treat containers or streams from the C++ Standard Library as databases! How cool is that?

 namespace  sql  =  sqlpp::container;

struct  sample 
{
	int64_t  alpha;
	std::string beta;
	bool  gamma;
};

int  main ()
{
	using  container = std::vector<sample>;
	container data;

	sql::connection<container> db (data);
	sample tab;

	db. run ( insert_into (tab). set (tab. alpha  = 17 ));
	db. run ( insert_into (tab). set (tab. beta  = " cheesecake "  ));
	db. run ( insert_into (tab). set (tab. alpha  = 42 , tab. beta  = " hello "  , tab. gamma  = true ));
	db. run ( insert_into (tab). set (tab. gamma  = true ));

	for  ( const  sample& row: db. run ( select ( all_of ( tab (tab))
	                                 . from (tab)
	                                 . where (tab. alpha  < 18 )))
	{
		std::cerr << " alpha= "   << row. alpha  << 
		           " , beta= "   << row. beta  << 
		           " , gamma= "   << row. gamma  << std::endl;
	}

	return  0 ;
}

That works???

Oh yes! Check it out. You need:

    A current C++11 compiler (clang-3.2 and g++-4.8 are known to work on Ubuntu)
    sqlpp11: https://github.com/rbock/sqlpp11
    And this library, of course

Stay tuned for more :-)
