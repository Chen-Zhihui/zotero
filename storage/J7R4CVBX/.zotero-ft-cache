README

 ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects
to a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,
columns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.
For more information see:

http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/ 

This package contains the MySQL ODB runtime library. Every application
that includes code generated for the MySQL database will need to link
to this library.

See the NEWS file for the user-visible changes from the previous release.

See the LICENSE file for distribution conditions.

See the INSTALL file for prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback to the 
odb-users@codesynthesis.com mailing list.
