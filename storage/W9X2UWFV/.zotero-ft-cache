PyUDT

PyUDT is a python binding to the high-performance UDT library .

This extension will only work with CPython on a Linux system. Some minor fixes may be needed to make it function on Unix, and there is no attempt to make it functional on Windows.`
Installation

In this module is a submodule ./udt which links to the Sourceforge GIT repo of the UDT development. Alternatively you can use your own installation.

Note that the standard udt Makefile does not specify an install command, the local extension will look in the usual places, however you may need to change setup.py if you have installed to an unusual place.
Usage

Using pydoc udt4 and pydoct udt4.pyudt are the best sources for documentation, there exists no external documentation.
The code is fairly well commented, especially when the interface differs from the C++ API interface.

There are no documented examples however there are unit tests in ./test/ which accomplish more or less the same goal.

The library is broken up into two independent parts:

    Content imported from the udt4 interface
    Content imported from the udt4.pyudt interface

udt4

 import  udt4 as  udt 

The plain udt4 import seeks to have a near 1-to-1 correspondence with the base UDT C++ library. There are no classes, only function calls where the first argument is a reference to a udt4.UDTSOCKET type, which is internally represented by the UDTSOCKET C-type (though for convenience reasons retains some information about how it was created).

udt4.UDTSOCKET

 # Raw socket object.  

Classes designed to be operated on by udt4 functions.

socket =  udt4.socket( ...  ) 
print (socket)                   # <type 'UDTSOCKET'>  

udt4.UDTepoll

 epoll  =  udt4.UDTepoll() 
print (epoll)                    # <type 'UDTepoll'>  

epoll.add_usock( < type  ' UDTSOCKET '  >  socket, int (flags)) 

udt4.pyudt

 from  udt4 import  pyudt as  udt  

The pyudt implementation tries to more closely match the python socket interface where possible. Not all functions available in socket are available in pyudt.UdtSocket() .

Classes designed to work with other pyudt classes.

pyudt.UdtSocket()

 socket =  pyudt.UdtSocket( ...  ) 
print (socket)                   # <udt4.pyudt.UdtSocket object>  

pyudt.Epoll()

 epoll =  pyudt.Epoll() 
print (epoll)                    # <udt4.pyudt.Epoll object>  

epoll.add_usock( < udt4.pyudt.UdtSocket object >  socket, int (flags))
