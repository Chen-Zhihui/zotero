sqlpp11-connector-sqlite

Sample Code:

See for instance tests/SampleTest.cpp

 namespace  sql  =  sqlpp::sqlite3;
int  main () {
    sql::connection_config config;
    config. path_to_database  = " :memory: "  ;
    config. flags  = SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE | SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE;
    config. debug  = true ;

    sql::connection db (config);
    std::cerr << __FILE__ << " : "   << __LINE__ << std::endl;
    db. execute ( " CREATE TABLE tab_sample (\ 
alpha bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,\ 
beta varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\ 
gamma bool DEFAULT NULL\ 
) "  );

    TabSample tab;
    // explicit all_of(tab) 
    for ( const  auto & row : db ( select ( all_of (tab)). from (tab). unconditionally ()))
    {
        int64_t  alpha = row. alpha ;
        std::string beta = row. beta ;
        bool  gamma  = row. gamma ;
    };

Requirements:

Compiler: sqlpp11-connector-sqlite3 makes use of C++11 and requires a recent compiler and STL. The following compilers are known to compile the test programs:

    clang-3.2 on Ubuntu-12.4
    g++-4.8 on Ubuntu-12.4

Libraries:

    sqlpp11-connector-sqlite3 is meant to be used with sqlpp11 ( https://github.com/rbock/sqlpp11 ).
    sqlpp11 requires date.h ( https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date ).
    libsqlite3, version 3.7.11 or later is required to use multi-row insert. Older versions (e.g. 3.7.9) work fine otherwise.

Breaking Changes:

Version 0.24, handling of password for encrypted databases:

The call to sqlite3_key used to include a null character at the end of the password provided in the connection_config. This prevented users from using the "x'HEXHEXHEX'" syntax that skips the key derivation and made interoperability with other tools more complex.

The call has been fixed, which implies that databases created with sqlpp11 won't open anymore without changing user code. To adapt to this change, you must explicitely append a null character to the database password:

 config.password.push_back( ' \0 '  );

You can also update your database to migrate them to a password without the extra null character with sqlite3_rekey .
