4D Face Model

The 4D Face Model (4DFM) is a 3D Morphable Model of human faces. Our model is created from hundreds of physically accurate 3D scans of human faces. The model is able to express a variety of expressions like lip movements or emotions like surprise or anger.

Our model is the perfect technology to drive applications in augmented or virtual reality (AR/VR), games, films, or health care.
