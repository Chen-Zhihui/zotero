The Point Cloud Library ( PCL ) is an open-source library of algorithms for point cloud processing tasks and 3D geometry processing , such as occur in three-dimensional computer vision . The library contains algorithms for feature estimation, surface reconstruction, 3D registration [4] , model fitting , and segmentation . It is written in C++ and released under the BSD license .

These algorithms have been used, for example, for perception in robotics to filter outliers from noisy data, stitch 3D point clouds together , segment relevant parts of a scene, extract keypoints and compute descriptors to recognize objects in the world based on their geometric appearance, and create surfaces from point clouds and visualize them.

History [ edit ]

The development of the Point Cloud Library started in March 2010 at Willow Garage . The project initially resided on a sub domain of Willow Garage then moved to a new website www.pointclouds.org in March 2011. [1] PCL's first official release (Version 1.0) was released two months later in May 2011. [2]
Modules [ edit ]

PCL is split into a number of modular libraries. [6]
