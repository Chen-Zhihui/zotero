Keras-OpenFace

Keras-OpenFace is a project converting OpenFace from it's original Torch implementation to a Keras version
If you are only interested in using pre-trained model

Load the Keras OpenFace model(Accuracy: 0.938+-0.013)

 from  keras.models import  load_model
from  keras.utils import  CustomObjectScope
import  tensorflow as  tf
with  CustomObjectScope({ ' tf '  : tf}):
  model =  load_model( ' ./model/nn4.small2.v1.h5 '  )

Running the whole convertion process and look into Kears-Openface-convertion.ipynb

 $ jupyter notebook  

CoreML-OpenFace

Pre-trained CoreML version of OpenFace in model/openface.coreml which you can easily integrate OpenFace into your iOS application.
