OpenFace- Facial Landmark Detection and Facial Expression Analysis Software
Details
Project Title 	OpenFace- Facial Landmark Detection and Facial Expression Analysis Software
Track Code 	OpenFace
Website 	https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace
Short Description 	

OpenFace is a toolkit for building interactive applications based on facial behavior analysis. OpenFace is capable of facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, facial action unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation. The computer vision algorithms which represent the core of OpenFace demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all of the above mentioned tasks. OpenFace is capable of real-time performance, able to run from a simple webcam without any specialist hardware, and allows for easy integration with other applications and devices through a lightweight messaging system.  

Three different packages are available for commercial licensing:

OpenFace Light   - a light toolkit without advanced model files for facial landmark recognition.  For illustrative purposes e.g. source code for very facial landmark detection (smaller training dataset used)

OpenFace 2.0 Landmarks - a robust facial landmark detection and tracking toolkit, including eye gaze estimation/tracking

OpenFace 2.0 Full Suite -a robust facial behavior analysis toolkit, including robust facial landmark detection and tracking, eye gaze estimation/tracking, and facial expression analysis/facial action unit recognition
