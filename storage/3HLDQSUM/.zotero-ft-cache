Installation Methods

    To use with a specific project, simply copy the pyqtgraph subdirectory anywhere that is importable from your project. PyQtGraph may also be used as a git subtree by cloning the git-core repository from github.
    To install system-wide from source distribution: $ python setup.py install
    For installation packages, see the website (pyqtgraph.org)
    On debian-like systems, pyqtgraph requires the following packages: python-numpy, python-qt4 | python-pyside For 3D support: python-opengl, python-qt4-gl | python-pyside.qtopengl

Documentation

There are many examples; run python -m pyqtgraph.examples for a menu.

Some (incomplete) documentation exists at this time.

    Easiest place to get documentation is at http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation
    If you acquired this code as a .tar.gz file from the website, then you can also look in doc/html.
    If you acquired this code via GitHub, then you can build the documentation using sphinx. From the documentation directory, run: $ make html

Please feel free to pester Luke or post to the forum if you need a specific section of documentation to be expanded.
