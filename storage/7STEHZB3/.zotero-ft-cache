Caffe-model

Caffe models (include classification, detection and segmentation) and deploy prototxt for resnet, resnext, inception_v3, inception_v4, inception_resnet, wider_resnet, densenet, aligned-inception-resne(x)t, DPNs and other networks.

Clone the caffe-model repository

 git clone https://github.com/soeaver/caffe-model --recursive

We recommend using these caffe models with py-RFCN-priv

Please install py-RFCN-priv for evaluating and finetuning.
Disclaimer

Most of the pre-train models are converted from other projects, the main contribution belongs to the original authors.
