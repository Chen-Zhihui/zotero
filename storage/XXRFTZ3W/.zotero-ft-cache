        Emotion API
        Face API
        Video API

    Speech
        Bing Speech API
        Custom Recognition Intelligent Service (CRIS)
        Speaker Recognition API

    Language
        Bing Spell Check API
        Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)
        Linguistic Analysis API
        Text Analytics API ( Click for sample project on Topic Detection )

    Knowledge
        Academic Knowledge API
        Entity Linking Intelligent Service

Signing-up Cognitive Services APIs:

You can sign-up for any of the above services from request trial page, or from your Azure Management Portal with following steps.

    Go to the Azure Portal at http://portal.azure.com/ and sign in with your Azure account.

    Click on + New.

    Select the Intelligence option.

    Select the Cognitive Services APIs product. This product will allow you to start a subscription for any of the cognitive services APIs (Face, Text Analytics, Computer Vision, etc.).

    On the Cognitive Services API landing page, enter the Account name for your service subscription. (For instace: "MyFaceRecService, MyRecommendations"). This name should not have any spaces in it.

    On API type, select one of the services (Face, Text Analytics, Computer Vision, etc.) that you want to subscribe.

    On Pricing tier, you can select a plan. You may select the Free tier i.e. for 10,000 transactions/month. This is a free plan, so it is a good way to start trying the system. Once you go to production, we recommend you consider your request volume and change the plan type accordingly. (Note: You can have only one Free tier subscription at a time)

    Select a Resource Group, or create a new one if you don't have one already.

    You may change other elements in the Create dialog. We should point out that the resource provider today is only supported from United States data centers.

    Once you are done with any selections, click Create.

    Wait a few minutes for the resource to be deployed. Once it is deployed, you can go to the Keys section in the Settings blade where you will be provided a primary and secondary key to use the API. Copy the primary key, as you'll need it when creating your first model.
