Face Everthing

face detection alignment recognition reconstruction base on some projects on github, aim to build state of art face system. currently reconstruction is not available, code is not elegant.
Reference
Project

    OpenFace
    openpose
    mtcnn
    SeetaFace
    FaceAlignment3000
    ExplicitShapeRegression
    SphereFace

Paper

    OpenFace: an open source facial behavior analysis toolkit
    Constrained Local Neural Fields for robust facial landmark detection in the wild
    Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields
    Hand Keypoint Detection in Single Images using Multiview Bootstrapping
    Convolutional pose machines
    Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks
    SphereFace: Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition
    Large-Margin Softmax Loss for Convolutional Neural Networks

Features
mtcnn align casia dataset (cpp implement matlab cp2tform)

Success algin 453078 of 455594 images, take about 1.11hour, hope someone can increase detection rate and reduce run time.

    Aligned example

[aligned example]

    Failed example

[failed aligned thumbnail]
put all in one, mtcnn detection, openpose alignment, cln tracking and sphereface recognition

Installation
Requirements

    OpenCV (>=3.0)
    Boost (>=1.63)
    SphereCaffe
    CUDA (>=8.0)

Complie

    Install all requirements
    git clone https://github.com/tpys/face-everthing.git
    change line 44 & 45 in CMakeList.txt to your spherecaffe corresponding directory
    cd face-everthing && mkdir build && cd build && make -j4

Run Example

    Download trained model( https://pan.baidu.com/s/1boOOBNL code: juk3)
    Modify example/mtcnn_align_dataset.cpp, change the input parameters to yours
    Modify example/all_in_one.cpp, change the input parameters to yours

TODO:

    move cln part to tracking modules
    add recently fan 2d & 3d alignment
    speed up alignment, maybe batch gpu forward, small model, gpu implementation tracking.
    train more accurate recognition model
