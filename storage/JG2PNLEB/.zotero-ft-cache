Image Debugger Plug-in for Visual Studio

Mar 27, 2013

Dear OpenCV Developers,

We are happy to announce the public release of Image Watch, our image debug visualizer for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.

Image Watch is a Visual Studio plug-in that lets you view in-memory images while debugging an OpenCV application.

These are some of the key features:

    view all in-memory images in the current scope, or pin images to a "watch" list
    watch how pixels change after a single instruction or between breakpoints
    pan/zoom, inspect numeric pixel values
    make quick visual A/B comparisons between any two image regions
    apply simple operators such as thresholding, clamping, pixel-wise difference
    supports cv::Mat_<>, cv::Mat, CvMat, and _IplImage types
    can be extended for viewing custom C++ image types

Image Watch is free and can be downloaded at http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e682d542-7ef3-402c-b857-bbfba714f78d .

A short tutorial video is available at http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Introducing-Image-Watch .

Also tutorial on Image Watch is available on OpenCV documentation website .

Best regards,
Wolf Kienzle
