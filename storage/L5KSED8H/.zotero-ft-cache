Generating Faces with Deconvolution Networks

Example generations

This repo contains code to train and interface with a deconvolution network adapted from this paper to generate faces using data from the Radboud Faces Database . Requires Keras , NumPy , SciPy , and tqdm with Python 3 to use.

A blog post describing this project can be found here .
Training New Models

To train a new model, simply run:

 python3 faces.py train path/to/data  

You can specify the number of deconvolution layers with -d to generate larger images, assuming your GPU has the memory for it. You can play with the batch size and the number of kernels per layer (using -b and -k respectively) until it fits in memory, although this may result in worse results or longer training.

Using 6 deconvolution layers with a batch size of 8 and the default number of kernels per layer, a model was trained on an Nvidia Titan X card (12 GB) to generate 512x640 images in a little over a day.
Generating Images

To generate images using a trained model, you can specify parameters in a yaml file and run:

 python3 faces.py generate -m path/to/model -o output/directory -f path/to/params.yaml  

There are four different modes you can use to generate images:

    single , produce a single image.
    random , produce a set of random images.
    drunk , similar to random, but produces a more contiguous sequence of images.
    interpolate , animate between a set of specified keyframes.

You can find examples of these files in the params directory, which should give you a good idea of how to format these and what's available.
Examples
