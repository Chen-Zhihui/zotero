Profiling QML Applications

You can use the QML Profiler to find causes for typical performance problems in your applications, such as slowness and unresponsive, stuttering user interfaces. Typical causes include executing too much JavaScript in too few frames. All JavaScript must return before the GUI thread can proceed, and frames are delayed or dropped if the GUI thread is not ready.

Another typical cause for similar performance problems is creating, painting, or updating invisible items, which takes time in the GUI thread.

Triggering long-running C++ functions, such as paint methods and signal handlers, also takes time in the GUI thread, but is more difficult to see in the QML Profiler, because it does not profile C++ code.

To find excessive use of JavaScript, check the frame rate in animations and Scene Graph events, look for gaps, and check whether the application behaves as expected. The JavaScript category displays the run time of functions, which you should try to keep below 16 ms per frame.

To find problems caused by handling invisible items, look for dropped frames and check that you are not using too many short bindings or signal handlers that are updated per frame. You can also visualize Scene Graph overdraw to check scene layout and find items that are never visible to the users, because they are located outside the screen or hidden beneath other, visible elements.

If frames get dropped even though JavaScript is not being run, and there are large, unexplained gaps in the timeline, check your custom QQuickItem implementations. You can use Valgrind or other general purpose profilers to analyze C++ code.
Using QML Profiler

To monitor the performance of an application in the QML Profiler:

    To be able to profile an application, you must set up QML debugging for the project. For more information, see Setting Up QML Debugging .
    In the Projects mode, select a kit with Qt version 4.7.4 or later.

    Note: To profile applications on devices , you must install Qt 4.7.4 or later libraries on them.
    Select Analyze > QML Profiler to profile the current application.
    Select the ( Start ) button to start the application from the QML Profiler.

    Note: If data collection does not start automatically, select the ( Enable Profiling ) button.

When you start analyzing an application, the application is launched, and the QML Profiler immediately begins to collect data. This is indicated by the time running in the Elapsed field.

Data is collected until you select the Enable Profiling button. Data collection takes time, and therefore, there might be a delay before the data is displayed.

Do not use application commands to exit the application, because data is sent to the QML Profiler when you select the Enable Profiling button. The application continues to run for some seconds, after which it is stopped automatically. If you exit the application, the data is not sent.

Select the Disable Profiling button to disable the automatic start of the data collection when an application is launched. Data collection starts when you select the button again.

To save all the collected data, right-click any QML Profiler view to open the context menu, and then select Save QML Trace . To view the saved data, select Load QML Trace . You can also deliver the saved data to other developers for examination or load data saved by them.
Specifying Flushing Settings

You can specify flushing settings for the QML Profiler either globally for all projects or separately for each project. To specify global settings, select Tools > Options > Analyzer .

To specify custom QML Profiler settings for a particular project, select Projects > Run and then select Custom in QML Profiler Settings . To restore the global settings for the project, select Restore Global .

"QML Profiler Settings"

Select the Flush data while profiling check box to flush the data periodically instead of flushing all data when profiling stops. This saves memory on the target device and shortens the wait between the profiling being stopped and the data being displayed.

In the Flush interval field, set the flush interval in milliseconds. The shorter the interval, the more often the data is flushed. The longer the interval, the more data has to be buffered in the target application, potentially wasting memory. However, the flushing itself takes time, which can distort the profiling results.

If you have multiple QML engines and you want to aggregate the data produced by all of them into one trace, select the Process data only when process ends check box. Otherwise, the profiling stops when one of the engines stops.
Attaching to Running Qt Quick Applications

To profile Qt Quick applications that are not launched by Qt Creator, select Analyze > QML Profiler (External) . You must enable QML debugging and profiling for the application in the project build settings. For more information, see Setting Up QML Debugging .

In the QML Profiler dialog, Port field, specify the port to listen to.
Analyzing Collected Data

The Timeline view displays graphical representations of QML and JavaScript execution and a condensed view of all recorded events.

"QML Profiler"

Each row in the timeline (6) describes a type of QML events that were recorded. Move the cursor on an event on a row to see how long it takes and where in the source it is being called. To display the information only when an event is selected, disable the View Event Information on Mouseover button (4).

The outline (10) summarizes the period for which data was collected. Drag the zoom range (8) or click the outline to move on the outline. You can also move between events by selecting the Jump to Previous Event and Jump to Next Event buttons (1).

Select the Show Zoom Slider button (2) to open a slider that you can use to set the zoom level. You can also drag the zoom handles (9). To reset the default zoom level, right-click the timeline to open the context menu, and select Reset Zoom .

Click the time ruler to add vertical orientation lines (5) to the timeline.
Selecting Event Ranges

You can select an event range (7) to view the frame rate of events and to compare it with the frame rate of similar events. Select the Select Range button (3) to activate the selection tool. Then click in the timeline to specify the beginning of the event range. Drag the selection handle to define the end of the range. The length of the range indicates the frame rate of the event.

You can use event ranges also to measure delays between two subsequent events. Place a range between the end of the first event and the beginning of the second event. The Duration field displays the delay between the events in milliseconds.

To zoom into an event range, double-click it.

To remove an event range, close the Selection dialog.
Understanding the Data

Generally, events in the timeline view indicate how long QML or JavaScript execution took. Move the mouse over them to see details. For most events, they include location in source code, duration and some relevant parts of the source code itself.

You can click on an event to move the cursor in the code editor to the part of the code the event is associated with.

The following types of events are displayed in the timeline view on one or several rows. The availability of event types depends on the version of Qt the application was compiled with and the version of Qt Quick it is using.
Event Category 	Description 	Minimum Qt Version 	Qt Quick Version
Pixmap Cache 	Displays the general amount of pixmap data cached, in pixels. In addition, displays a separate event for each picture being loaded, with specifics about its file name and size. 	Qt 5.1 	Qt Quick 2
Scene Graph 	Displays the time when scene graph frames are rendered and some additional timing information for the various stages executed to do so. 	Qt 5.1 	Qt Quick 2
Memory Usage 	Displays block allocations of the JavaScript memory manager. Generally, the memory manager will reserve larger blocks of memory in one piece and later hand them out to the application in smaller bits. If the application requests single blocks of memory surpassing a certain size, the memory manager will allocate those separately. Those two modes of operation are shown as events of different colors. The second row displays the actual usage of the allocated memory. This is the amount of JavaScript heap the application has actually requested. 	Qt 5.4 	Qt Quick 2
Input Events 	Displays mouse and keyboard events. 	Qt 4.7.4 	Qt Quick 1 or Qt Quick 2
Painting 	Displays the time spent painting the scene for each frame. 	Qt 4.7.4 	Qt Quick 1
Animations 	Displays the amount of animations that are active and the frame rate that they are running at. Information about render thread animations is displayed for applications that are built with Qt 5.3 or later. Render thread animations are shown in a separate row then. 	Qt 5.0 (Qt 5.3) 	Qt Quick 2
Compiling 	Displays the time spent compiling the QML files. 	Qt 4.7.4 	Qt Quick 1 or Qt Quick 2
Creating 	Displays the time spent creating the elements in the scene. In Qt Quick 2, creation of elements takes place in two stages. The first stage is for the creation of the data structures, including child elements. The second stage represents the completion callbacks. Not all elements trigger completion callbacks, though. The stages are shown as separate events in the timeline. For Qt Quick 2 applications compiled with versions of Qt before 5.2.1 only the creation of top-level elements is shown, as single events. 	Qt 4.7.4 (Qt 5.2.1) 	Qt Quick 1 or Qt Quick 2
Binding 	Displays the time when a binding is evaluated and how long the evaluation takes. 	Qt 4.7.4 	Qt Quick 1 or Qt Quick 2
Handling Signal 	Displays the time when a signal is handled and how long the handling takes. 	Qt 4.7.4 	Qt Quick 1 or Qt Quick 2
JavaScript 	Displays the time spent executing the actual JavaScript behind bindings and signal handlers. It lists all the JavaScript functions you may be using to evaluate bindings or handle signals. 	Qt 5.3 	Qt Quick 2
Analyzing Scene Graph Events

In order to understand the scene graph category, it's important to understand how the Qt Quick scene graph works. See Qt Quick Scene Graph and Qt Quick Scene Graph Renderer for a detailed description. The following events are reported in the Scene Graph category. Not all events are generated by all render loops. In the Windows and Basic render loops everything runs in the same thread and the distinction between GUI thread and render thread is meaningless.

If you set the environment variable QSG_RENDER_TIMING, you get a textual output of similar, but slightly different timings from the application being profiled. For easier orientation, the differences are listed below.
Event Type 	Thread 	Render Loop Types 	Label in output of QSG_RENDER_TIMING 	Description 	Caveats
Polish 	GUI 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	polish 	Final touch-up of items before they are rendered using QQuickItem::updatePolish (). 	Versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.4 record no polish times for the basic render loop and incorrect ones for the windows render loop.
GUI Thread Wait 	GUI 	Threaded 	lock 	Executing slots connected to the QQuickWindow::afterAnimating () signal and then locking the render thread's mutex before waiting on the same mutex at GUI Thread Sync . If this starts long before Render Thread Sync , there is free time in the GUI thread you could be using for running additional QML or JavaScript. 	None
GUI Thread Sync 	GUI 	Threaded 	blockedForSync 	The time the GUI thread is blocked, waiting for the render thread. 	None
Animations 	GUI 	Threaded, Windows 	animations 	Advancing animations in the GUI thread. The basic render loop does not drive animations in sync with the rendering. This is why no animation events will be shown when using the basic render loop. Watch the Animations category to see animation timing in this case. 	None
Render Thread Sync 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	Frame rendered ... sync 	Synchronizing the QML state into the scene graph using QQuickItem::updatePaintNode (). 	None
Render 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	Frame rendered ... render 	Total time spent rendering the frame, including preparing and uploading all the necessary data to the GPU. This is the gross render time. Do not confuse it with the net Render Render time below. 	With versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.5, the gross render time and the below breakup of render times may be misaligned by some microseconds due to different, unsynchronized timers being used to measure them. For example Render Preprocess might seem to start before Render Thread Sync is finished.
Swap 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	Frame rendered ... swap 	Swapping frames after rendering. 	The output of swap times triggered by setting QSG_RENDER_TIMING is incorrect for the basic render loop and versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.4. The QML profiler shows the correct swap times.
Render Preprocess 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	time in renderer ... preprocess 	Calling QSGNode::preprocess () on all nodes that need to be preprocessed. This is part of the gross Render step. 	May not be properly aligned with Render with versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.5.
Render Update 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	time in renderer ... updates 	Iterating and processing all the nodes in the scene graph to update their geometry, transformations, opacity, and other state. In the Render Thread Sync stage, each node is updated separately with state from the GUI thread. In Render Update , all the nodes are combined to create the final scene. This is part of the gross Render step. 	May not be properly aligned with Render with versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.5.
Render Bind 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	time in renderer ... binding 	Binding the correct framebuffer for OpenGL rendering. This is part of the gross Render step. 	May not be properly aligned with Render with versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.5.
Render Render 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	time in renderer ... rendering 	The actual process of sending all the data to the GPU via OpenGL. This is part of the gross Render step. 	May not be properly aligned with Render with versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.5.
Material Compile 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	shader compiled 	Compiling GLSL shader programs. 	None
Glyph Render 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	glyphs ... rendering 	Rendering of font glyphs into textures. 	Versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.4 report incorrect times for these events.
Glyph Upload 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	glyphs ... upload 	Uploading of glyph textures to the GPU. 	Versions of Qt prior to Qt 5.4 report incorrect times for these events.
Texture Bind 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	plain texture ... bind 	Binding a texture in the OpenGL context using glBindTextures. 	None
Texture Convert 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	plain texture ... convert 	Converting the format and downscaling an image to make it suitable for usage as a texture. 	None
Texture Swizzle 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	plain texture ... swizzle 	Swizzling the texture data on the CPU if necessary. 	None
Texture Upload 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	plain texture ... upload / atlastexture uploaded 	Uploading the texture data to the GPU. 	None
Texture Mipmap 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	plain texture ... mipmap 	Mipmapping a texture on the GPU. 	None
Texture Delete 	Render 	Threaded, Basic, Windows 	plain texture deleted 	Deleting a texture from the GPU that became unnecessary. 	None
Viewing Statistics

The Statistics view displays the number of times each binding, create, compile, JavaScript, or signal event is triggered and the average time it takes. This allows you to examine which events you need to optimize. A high number of occurrences might indicate that an event is triggered unnecessarily. To view the median, longest, and shortest time for the occurrences, select Extended Event Statistics in the context menu.

Click on an event to move to it in the source code in the code editor.

"Statistics view"

The Callers and Callees panes show dependencies between events. They allow you to examine the internal functions of the application. The Callers pane summarizes the QML events that trigger a binding. This tells you what caused a change in a binding. The Callees pane summarizes the QML events that a binding triggers. This tells you which QML events are affected if you change a binding.

Click on an event to move to it in the source code in the code editor.

When you select an event in the Timeline view, information about it is displayed in the Statistics view. To view an event range in the Statistics view, select Analyze Current Range in the context menu in the Timeline view.

To copy the contents of one view or row to the clipboard, select Copy Table or Copy Row in the context menu.

JavaScript events are shown in the Statistics view only for applications that use Qt Quick 2 and are compiled with Qt 5.3 or later.
Visualizing Statistics as Flame Graphs

The Flame Graph view shows a more concise statistical overview of QML and JavaScript execution. In the Visualize Total Time view, the horizontal bars show the amount of time all invocations of a certain function took together, relative to the total runtime of all JavaScript and QML events. The nesting shows which functions were called by which other ones.

"Flame Graph View"

To view the total amount of memory allocated by the functions in the Visualize Memory view, select Memory in the drop-down menu (1).

To view the the number of memory allocations performed by the functions in the Visualize Allocations view, select Allocations in the drop-down menu.

Double-click an item in a view to zoom into it. Double-click an empty area in the view to zoom out again.

Unlike the Timeline view, the Flame Graph view does not show the time spans when no QML or JavaScript is running at all. Thus, it is not suitable for analyzing per frame execution times. However, it is very easy to see the total impact of the various QML and JavaScript events there.
