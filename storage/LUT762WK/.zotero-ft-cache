Python API for SeetaFace on Linux
Description

This is a python API for SeetaFace on Linux. Based on Seetaface source files, I did some changes in CMakeLists files and wrote so_api.cpp in src folders as cpp interfaces respectively.
Interfaces

face_detect :Detects faces in an image.

face_align :Detects faces in an image, returns 5 landmarks, i.e., 2 left eye centers, nose tip and two mouth corners, in every face.

face_verify :Detects only one face and its landmarks in every image, calculates the similarity of these two faces.

see seetaface_api.py for more details.
Required Libs

    openCV
    cmake

How to Build Share Libs

Just follow the steps in README.md in every folders.
Tips

If you have any trouble with -lopencv_dep_cudart , try cmake .. -DCUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME=OFF from the very beginning.

About Seetaface

SeetaFace Engine is an open source C++ face recognition engine, which can run on CPU with no third-party dependence. It contains three key parts, i.e., SeetaFace Detection , SeetaFace Alignment and SeetaFace Identification , which are necessary and sufficient for building a real-world face recognition applicaiton system.
