VGG Face Descriptor
Omkar M. Parkhi , Andrea Vedaldi , Andrew Zisserman

Overview


This page contains the download links for the source code for computing the VGG-Face CNN descriptor, described in [1].

The VGG-Face CNN descriptors are computed using our CNN implementation based on the VGG-Very-Deep-16 CNN architecture as described in [1] and are evaluated on the Labeled Faces in the Wild [2] and the YouTube Faces [3] dataset.

Additionally the code also contains our fast implementation of the DPM Face detector of [3] using the cascade DPM code of [4].
Details of how to crop the face given a detection can be found in vgg_face_matconvnet package below in class faceCrop in +lib/+face_proc directory.

The goal of this paper is face recognition -- from either a single photograph or from a set of faces tracked in a video. Recent progress in this area has been due to two factors: (i) end to end learning for the task using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and (ii) the availability of very large scale training datasets. We make two contributions: first, we show how a very large scale dataset (2.6M images, over 2.6K people) can be assembled by a combination of automation and human in the loop, and discuss the trade off between data purity and time; second, we traverse through the complexities of deep network training and face recognition to present methods and procedures to achieve comparable state of the art results on the standard LFW and YTF face benchmarks.
