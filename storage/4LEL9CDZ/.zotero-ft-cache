cvplot

Graph plots, drawing, layout and windows in OpenCV.
About

Yet another cvplot library? Yes. Because they're all pretty bad. Like this one.
Build

Install the dependencies CMake and OpenCV. If you're on macOS, use Homebrew:

 brew install cmake opencv  

On Ubuntu:

 apt-get install cmake libopencv-dev  

Next build using CMake. The easiest way:

 make  

Internally it creates a build folder and runs CMake from there.

This project is developed and tested on macOS and Ubuntu.
Example

To draw a simple line graph:

 cvplot::figure("myplot").series("myline") .addValue({1.f, 3.f, 2.f, 5.f, 4.f}); cvplot::figure("myplot").show();  

cvplot example
Features

    Graphs: line, histogram, scatter
    Time series, parametric, range
    Automatic and dynamic coloring
    Transparency
    Image and text drawing
    Sub-windows (views)
    Window and view layout
    Green view frame
    Mouse support
    OpenCV-like API (highgui)
    Distinguished dated look

Demo

To see some of the plotting in action, run the demo:

 make demo  

cvplot demo

The style of windows and colors are intentionally pale and pixelated to give a dated feel to the whole thing.
Test

If googletest is available on your system, run tests with:

 make test
