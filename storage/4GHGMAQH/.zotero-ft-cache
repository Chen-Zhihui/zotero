Load Highcharts as a CommonJS module

Highcharts is using an UMD module pattern, as a result it has support for CommonJS. The following examples presumes you are using npm to install Highcharts, see Download and install Highcharts for more details.

 // Load Highcharts 
var  Highcharts =  require ( ' highcharts '  );
// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar. 
// var Highcharts = require('highcharts/highstock'); 

// Load the exporting module, and initialize it. 
require ( ' highcharts/modules/exporting '  )(Highcharts);

// Generate the chart 
Highcharts . chart ( ' container '  , {
  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts 
});

Load Highcharts as an ES6 module

Since Highcharts supports CommonJS, it can be loaded as an ES6 module with the use of transpilers. Two common transpilers are Babel and TypeScript . These have different interpretations of a CommonJS module, which affects your syntax. The following examples presumes you are using npm to install Highcharts, see Download and install Highcharts for more details.
Babel

 import  Highcharts  from  ' highcharts '  ;
// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar. 
// import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock'; 

// Load the exporting module. 
import  Exporting  from  ' highcharts/modules/exporting '  ;
// Initialize exporting module. 
Exporting (Highcharts);

// Generate the chart 
Highcharts . chart ( ' container '  , {
  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts 
});

TypeScript

 import  *  as  Highcharts  from  ' highcharts '  ;
// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar. 
// import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock'; 

// Load the exporting module. 
import  *  as  Exporting  from  ' highcharts/modules/exporting '  ;
// Initialize exporting module. 
Exporting (Highcharts);

// Generate the chart 
Highcharts . chart ( ' container '  , {
  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts 
});

Build and debug

If you want to do modifications to Highcharts or fix issues, you may build your own files. Highcharts uses Gulp as the build system. After npm install in the root folder, run gulp , which will set up a watch task for the JavaScript and SCSS files. Now any changes in the files of the /js or /css folders will result in new files being built and saved in the code folder. Other tasks are also available, like gulp lint .

 npm install gulp
