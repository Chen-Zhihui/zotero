Menoh

travis Build status Coverity Scan Build Status

Menoh is DNN inference library with C API.

Menoh is released under MIT License.

DISCLAIMER: Menoh is still experimental. Use it at your own risk. In particular not all operators in ONNX are supported, so please check whether the operators used in your model are supported. We have checked that VGG16 and ResNet50 models converted by onnx-chainer work fine.

Document

This codebase contains C API and C++ API.
Goal

    DNN Inference with CPU
    ONNX support
    Easy to use.
