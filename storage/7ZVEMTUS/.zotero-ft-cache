FaceDatasets

Some scripts to process face datasets.
Dataset Overlapping Problem

In face verification, it is important to perform open-set evaluation, i.e. there should be no overlapping identities between the training set and testing set. However, this standard isn't always folllowed by researchers and engineers. In ./VGGFace2/match_names.py , I provide a python script to check if two names are from the same person. The overlapping list between several training and testing datasets are also provided.
