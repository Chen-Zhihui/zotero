tensorflow-image-detection

A generic image detection program that uses Google's Machine Learning library, Tensorflow and a pre-trained Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model called Inception .

This model has been pre-trained for the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge using the data from 2012, and it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like Dalmatian, dishwasher etc. The program applies Transfer Learning to this existing model and re-trains it to classify a new set of images.

This is a generic setup and can be used to classify almost any kind of image. I created a small demo that classifies two image data sets - my photos and my girlfriend's photos, and returns a prediction score denoting the possibility of it being my image or my girlfriend's image.

Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then install Tensorflow on your system, and clone this repo.

Usage
Prepare the image data sets

In order to start the transfer learning process, a folder named training_dataset needs to be created in the root of the project folder. This folder will contain the image data sets for all the subjects, for whom the classification is to be performed.

Create the training_dataset folder and add the images for all the data sets in the following manner -

 / 
| 
| 
----  / training_dataset
|     | 
|     | 
|     ----  / arun
|     |     arun1 . jpg 
|     |     arun2 . jpg 
|     |     ... 
|     | 
|     | 
|     ----  / erica
|          erica1 . jpg 
|          erica2 . jpg 
|          ... 
| 
|      

This enables classification of images between the arun and erica data sets.

    Make sure to include multiple variants of the subject (side profiles, zoomed in images etc.), the more the images, the better is the result.

Initiate transfer learning

Go to the project directory and run -

 $ bash train . sh 

This script installs the Inception model and initiates the re-training process for the specified image data sets.

Once the process is complete, it will return a training accuracy somewhere between 85% - 100% .

The training summaries , retrained graphs and retrained labels will be saved in a folder named tf_files .
Classify objects

 python3 classify . py 

This opens up the file dialog using which you can select your input file.

Once the input file is selected, the classifier will output the predictions for each data set. A prediction score between 0.8 to 1 is considered to be optimal.
