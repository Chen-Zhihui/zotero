C3D Model for Keras + TensorFlow

The scripts here are inspired by C3D Model for Keras gist, but specifically for Keras + TensorFlow (not Theano-backend).

To reproduce results:

    Run a script that does everything: bash do_everything.sh

OR, build a docker image, which will do all the steps of replication during the build:

 docker build -t c3d-keras .  

OR, run each of these steps:

    Download pretrained model: bash models/get_weights_and_mean.sh
    Download sport1mil labels: bash sports1m/get_labels.sh
    Download facebook/C3D caffe.proto file for conversion from caffe to Keras: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/C3D/master/C3D-v1.0/src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto
    Install protobuf per instruction in https://github.com/google/protobuf . In Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler will do.
    Compile the caffe.proto file for python: protoc --python_out=. caffe.proto
    Make sure the default keras config (in ~/.keras/keras.json ) has: tf image_dim_ordering, and tensorflow backend.
    Convert the pre-trained model from Caffe format to Keras: python convert_caffe_model.py
    Download test video: bash download_test_video.sh
    Run test: python test_model.py

Prerequisites

Known to work with the following python packages:

    Keras==2.0.0
    tensorflow==0.12.1
    h5py==2.6.0
    numpy==1.12.0
    cv2==3.1.0
    pydot==1.1.0
    graphviz

Some basic command-line tools:

    protobuf compiler
    wget
    youtube-dl

Results

A following classification probability plot is expected (saved as probabilities.png ). A peak at 367th class (probability = 71%) corresponds to basketball label.

Classification Probability Plot

The top 5 labels will also be reported, and should look something like:

 Position of maximum probability: 367 Maximum probability: 0.57953 Corresponding label: basketball Top 5 probabilities and labels: basketball: 0.57953 volleyball: 0.14435 streetball: 0.06718 freestyle wrestling: 0.03323 greco-roman wrestling: 0.03293
