cmake starter with google test and google benchmark

License: MIT

A cross-platform C++11 starter project with google test and google benchmark support.

This project template is using git submodule to include Google Benchmark, so you need either to do

 $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:PhDP/cmake-gtest-gbench-starter.git  

or

 $ git clone git@github.com:PhDP/cmake-gtest-gbench-starter.git $ cd cmake-gtest-gbench-starter $ git submodule init $ git submodule update  

The project will compile a library named nemo (of course: you should change the name, nemo means 'no one') and an executable named nemo_exe.
Organization

    src has the source files and the CMakeLists.txt to compile the library and executable.
    include has the header files.
    test has the tests and related CMakeLists.txt.
    bench has the benchmarks and related CMakeLists.txt.

The main CMakeLists.txt file at the root of the project has options and further documentation.
Build

Build Status

On Linux/Unix, to build and make the test:

 $ mkdir build && cd $_ $ cmake .. $ make  

By default, the makefiles will build the library, executable, tests, and benchmarks. The commands

 $ ./test/nemo_tests $ ./bench/nemo_benchmark  

will run the tests and benchmarks. And

 $ sudo make install  

will install (at least on Linux) the library and executable to your computer's path.

On Windows, you can use cmake to generate Visual Studio build files with the same 'cmake ..' command.

By default, the project will be built in RELEASE mode, use

 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG  

to build in DEBUG mode.

See the CMakeLists.txt file to see all the options.
