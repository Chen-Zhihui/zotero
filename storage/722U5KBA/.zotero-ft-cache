PyGitHub is a Python (2 and 3) library to access the GitHub API v3 . This library enables you to manage GitHub resources such as repositories, user profiles, and organizations in your Python applications.
Install

 $ pip install pygithub

Simple Demo

 from  github import  Github

# First create a Github instance: 

# using username and password 
g =  Github( " user "  , " password "  )

# or using an access token 
g =  Github( " access_token "  )

# Then play with your Github objects: 
for  repo in  g.get_user().get_repos():
    print (repo.name)
