OpenFace is an open source framework that implements state-of-the-art facial behavior analysis algorithms including: facial landmark detection, head pose tracking, eye gaze and facial Action Unit estimation.
Abstract

Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in automatic facial behavior analysis and understanding. We present OpenFace – an open source tool intended for computer vision and machine learning researchers, affective computing community and people interested in building interactive applications based on facial behavior analysis. OpenFace is the ﬁrst open source tool capable of facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, facial action unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation. The computer vision algorithms which represent the core of OpenFace demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all of the above mentioned tasks. Furthermore, our tool is capable of real-time performance and is able to run from a simple webcam without any specialist hardware. Finally, OpenFace allows for easy integration with other applications and devices through a lightweight messaging system.

Code

The code available for download uses the approaches described in the paper. However, the code is still in the process of being developend and improved (both for accuracy and speed). Therefore, the results of running the code on the datasets used in the paper are slightly those reported in the paper.

The code also contains experiment running scripts, with the results to expect from running the code on the publicly available datasets used in the paper and described below.

The exact code that was run in the paper can also be made available upon request. However that code is not cleaned up and would be slightly more difficult to follow.
