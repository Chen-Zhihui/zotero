Tablib: format-agnostic tabular dataset library
https://travis-ci.org/kennethreitz/tablib.svg?branch=master

Tablib is a format-agnostic tabular dataset library, written in Python.

Output formats supported:

    Excel (Sets + Books)
    JSON (Sets + Books)
    YAML (Sets + Books)
    Pandas DataFrames (Sets)
    HTML (Sets)
    TSV (Sets)
    OSD (Sets)
    CSV (Sets)
    DBF (Sets)

Note that tablib purposefully excludes XML support. It always will. (Note: This is a joke. Pull requests are welcome.)
Overview

tablib.Dataset()
    A Dataset is a table of tabular data. It may or may not have a header row. They can be build and manipulated as raw Python datatypes (Lists of tuples|dictionaries). Datasets can be imported from JSON, YAML, DBF, and CSV; they can be exported to XLSX, XLS, ODS, JSON, YAML, DBF, CSV, TSV, and HTML.
tablib.Databook()
    A Databook is a set of Datasets. The most common form of a Databook is an Excel file with multiple spreadsheets. Databooks can be imported from JSON and YAML; they can be exported to XLSX, XLS, ODS, JSON, and YAML.

Usage

Populate fresh data files:

 headers = ('first_name', 'last_name')

data = [
    ('John', 'Adams'),
    ('George', 'Washington')
]

data = tablib.Dataset(*data, headers=headers)

Intelligently add new rows:

 >>> data.append(('Henry', 'Ford'))

Intelligently add new columns:

 >>> data.append_col((90, 67, 83), header='age')

Slice rows:

 >>> print(data[:2])
[('John', 'Adams', 90), ('George', 'Washington', 67)]

Slice columns by header:

 >>> print(data['first_name'])
['John', 'George', 'Henry']

Easily delete rows:

 >>> del data[1]

Exports

Drumroll please...........
JSON!

 >>> print(data.export('json'))
[
  {
    "last_name": "Adams",
    "age": 90,
    "first_name": "John"
  },
  {
    "last_name": "Ford",
    "age": 83,
    "first_name": "Henry"
  }
]

YAML!

 >>> print(data.export('yaml'))
- {age: 90, first_name: John, last_name: Adams}
- {age: 83, first_name: Henry, last_name: Ford}

CSV...

 >>> print(data.export('csv'))
first_name,last_name,age
John,Adams,90
Henry,Ford,83

EXCEL!

 >>> with open('people.xls', 'wb') as f:
...     f.write(data.export('xls'))

DBF!

 >>> with open('people.dbf', 'wb') as f:
...     f.write(data.export('dbf'))

Pandas DataFrame!

 >>> print(data.export('df')):
      first_name last_name  age
0       John     Adams   90
1      Henry      Ford   83

It's that easy.
