Face identification using CNN + TPE demo

Face identification demo which implements the Triplet Probabilistic Embedding for Face Verification and Clustering work.

demo app screenshot
Requirements

    python3
    keras
    dlib
    scikit-image

Usage

Get all the files from here and put them to the model dir. Then start demo_app1.py .
Training

Download the face_template.npy and shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat from here and put them to the model dir.

Place training data in following order:

 data\ dev_protocol.npy dev\ 1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg ... test\ subject_0\ 1.jpg 2.jpg ... subject_1\ 1.jpg 2.jpg ... ... train\ subject_0\ 1.jpg 2.jpg ... subject_1\ 1.jpg 2.jpg ... ...  

Then run as follows:

    utils/load_data.py
    train_cnn.py
    train_tpe.py

Use the test scripts to test your model.
