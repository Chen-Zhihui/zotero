<h1>Regular Void (Revision 1)</h1>

<h2><a id="Abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This paper evaluates the current specification of <code>void</code> in C++ as an incomplete type with exceptional rules and proposes changes that would update <code>void</code> to instead be a complete, object type. The intent of this modification is to eliminate special casing in generic code where <code>void</code> may appear as a dependent type, such as the existing <code>std::promise&lt;void&gt;</code>
 specialization in the standard library, and to do so in a way that 
minimizes breakage of existing code. This also has the positive 
side-effect of simplifying the standard as a whole, due to the amendment
 or outright removal of several clauses that currently need to treat <code>void</code> separately and explicitly.</p>

<h2><a id="Motivation">Motivation</a></h2>

<p>One of the many powerful aspects of C++ is its ability to represent 
generic functions and types as exemplified by the algorithms and 
containers of the standard library, which are able to operate on 
built-in and user-defined types equivalently provided that the types 
involved model the necessary concepts. One of the underlying properties 
of the language that makes this feasible is the potential for 
user-defined types to behave in both a syntactically and semantically 
similar manner to built-in types. This is because the language gives 
built-in object types and user-defined types value semantics, and allows
 for overloading and generic functions by way of templates. In practice 
this usually works well, however, <code>void</code> types often pose 
difficulty in generic code because they are incomplete and not 
instantiable, even though they can be appear as the result type of a 
function that may be invoked in a generic setting. They are very unique 
with respect to built-in types, let alone user-defined ones.</p>

<p>Consider the following example, based on real-world code:</p>

<pre style="color:#000000;background:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#696969; ">// Invoke a Callable, logging its arguments and return value.</span>
<span style="color:#696969; ">// Requires an exact match of Callable&amp;&amp;'s pseudo function type and R(P...).</span>

<span style="color:#800080; ">}</span>
</pre>

<p>The above code is simple enough, however, it breaks down in one, very important case -- when the return type of the <code>Callable</code> happens to be <code>void</code>
 (rvalue reference return types are also not handled here such that we 
are able to take advantage of the named return value optimization). In 
the <code>void</code> case, we'd still expect <code>callable</code> to be invoked and to have its arguments logged. Perhaps more subtle, the call to <code>log.log_result(result)</code> is meaningful even if serialization of a <code>void</code> were to end up being a no-op, since the invocation of the function still signals a successful execution of <code>callable</code> (i.e. if we get there, <code>std::invoke</code>
 did not propagate an exception). Ideally, all of this code would just 
work as written and without further specialization or indirection to 
account for the case where <code>callable</code> returns <code>void</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="StandardExample">Example in the Standard</a></h3>

<p>The motivation for this change does not exist solely in user-written 
generic code, as symptoms of the underlying problem are visible even in 
the standard libary itself. Most cleary, this can be seen with the need 
for specializations of <code>std::promise</code> and <code>std::future</code> for the <code>void</code> type. It can further be seen in proposals such as the <code>void</code> specialization for the <code>expected</code> template<sup><a href="#References_Expected">[1]</a></sup>. Unfortunately, even though we already have specializations for <code>std::promise</code> that at least allow <code>std::promise&lt;void&gt;</code> to be created, dealing with that type in generic code by users is still difficult due to the way that <code>void</code>
 is handled in the language and the fact that the specializations 
provide no common interface for setting the promised value (this latter 
point does not actually have to be the case even without changes to the 
language itself, though such an interface would be less than ideal). An 
example of where things break down in simple generic code that deals 
with <code>std::promise</code> can be seen here:</p>

<pre style="color:#000000;background:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">template</span><span style="color:#800080; ">&lt;</span><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">class</span> T<span style="color:#808030; ">,</span> <span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">class</span> Fun<span style="color:#800080; ">&gt;</span>
<span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">void</span> set_value_with_result<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span><span style="color:#666616; ">std</span><span style="color:#800080; ">::</span>promise<span style="color:#800080; ">&lt;</span>T<span style="color:#800080; ">&gt;</span><span style="color:#808030; ">&amp;</span> p<span style="color:#808030; ">,</span> Fun fun<span style="color:#808030; ">)</span> <span style="color:#800080; ">{</span>
  p<span style="color:#808030; ">.</span>set_value<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span>fun<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span><span style="color:#808030; ">)</span><span style="color:#808030; ">)</span><span style="color:#800080; ">;</span>
<span style="color:#800080; ">}</span>
</pre>

<p>In the above code, if <code>T</code> happens to be <code>void</code>, our code will fail because <code>set_value</code> in that case takes no parameters other than the promise itself, and you also cannot pass a <code>void</code> expression as a function argument. If you want to properly handle void, you'd need an overload:</p>

<pre style="color:#000000;background:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">template</span><span style="color:#800080; ">&lt;</span><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">class</span> Fun<span style="color:#800080; ">&gt;</span>
<span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">void</span> set_value_with_result<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span><span style="color:#666616; ">std</span><span style="color:#800080; ">::</span>promise<span style="color:#800080; ">&lt;</span><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">void</span><span style="color:#800080; ">&gt;</span><span style="color:#808030; ">&amp;</span> p<span style="color:#808030; ">,</span> Fun fun<span style="color:#808030; ">)</span> <span style="color:#800080; ">{</span>
  fun<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span><span style="color:#808030; ">)</span><span style="color:#800080; ">;</span>
  p<span style="color:#808030; ">.</span>set_value<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span><span style="color:#808030; ">)</span><span style="color:#800080; ">;</span>
<span style="color:#800080; ">}</span>
</pre>

<p>In this simple case the overload is fairly trivial, but in practice, 
such functions can be sufficiently more complicated and it can be 
difficult to provide such overloads in a way that is not prone to error 
or full of explicit compile-time branching via template metaprogramming,
 or the proposed <code>constexpr_if</code>. In an ideal world, no overload nor branching would be required. This proposal makes that a reality.</p>

<p><i>Note: This paper strictly addresses language changes to <code>void</code> without proposing significant changes to the standard library. For changes to the standard library, such as the removal of the <code>void</code> specializations of <code>std::promise</code>, see the proposal drafts "Remove Future-Related Explicit Specializations for Void"</i> <sup><a href="#References_VoidFuture">[2]</a></sup><i> and "Standard Library Support for Void"</i> <sup><a href="#References_VoidStdLib">[3]</a></sup><i>, which both depend on the viability and acceptance of this proposal.</i></p>

<h3><a id="Simplification">Simplification and Teachability</a></h3>

<p>Apart from allowing the above motivating cases to be implemented and work as-is, the change of <code>void</code> to be a <code>Regular</code><sup><a href="#References_FoGP">[4]</a></sup> type also simplifies C++ itself by making the type system more consistent. Specifications in the standard that account for <code>void</code>
 change from being made up almost entirely of special cases, to being 
governed by the existing rules of object types, which is what <code>void</code> becomes as a part of this proposal. This makes it easier for users to think of <code>void</code>,
 as it allows them to think of it in much the same way that they do most
 other types in the language. It is akin to thinking of <code>0</code> as a number, which it is.</p>

<h2><a id="ProblemDesc">Problem Description</a></h2>

<p>Generic programming in C++ is especially powerful because with care, 
concept requirements can usually be specified in a way such that they 
may be met nonintrusively with respect to an existing type, making it 
possible to have the type model a concept even if a programmer otherwise
 has no control over its implementation (i.e. it is a part of a 
dependency or is a built-in type). However, sometimes requirements are 
specified that simply cannot be met nonintrusively. A good example of 
this is when a type requirement is the instantiability of that type, or 
proper semantics regarding special member functions. In these cases, if 
the type does not already meet these requirements, they cannot be met 
without modifying the type in question. If the type in question is a 
part of a dependency or happens to be a fundamental type of the 
language, then that type cannot be made to model the given concept 
without either patching the dependency or changing the language, 
respectively. This is particularly unfortunate if a type <i>could</i> model the concept without any cost, yet simply does not do so.</p>

<p>The problem that generic libraries face when dealing with <code>void</code> can be thought of as precisely this last case. As currently specified in the language, <code>void</code> cannot be instantiated, nor can it be copied or compared, even though it can be logically thought of as a monostate type.</p>

<h2><a id="RecommendedSolution">Recommended Solution</a></h2>

<p>Briefly, the solution that is recommended by this proposal is to change <code>void</code>
 to a complete object type and to do so in a way that prevents 
considerable breakage to existing code. Although this change may sound 
risky, the alterations are specified in such a way that potential 
breakage is limited. Descriptions of the few potential breaking cases 
are detailed later.</p>

<p>In reality, what is likely if these changes were to be made, is that 
most existing users of the language likely would not even notice the 
update had they not heard about it before-hand, and their code would not
 be affected adversely by such ignorance. What is proposed more formally
 below is a fairly straight-forward simplification to the standard, 
removing many parts that currently need to explicitly mention <code>void</code>
 types in wording due to their nature as a unique kind of type in C++. 
The most risky of changes are discussed in this documently explicitly, 
separate from the actual changes that are suggested for the standard.</p>

<h3><a id="ExistingPractice">Existing Practice in Other Languages</a></h3>

<p>The notion of <code>void</code> as an instatiable type is nothing particularly new to programming languages as a whole. Indeed, descriptions of <code>void</code> types at a more general level than C++ present <code>void</code> as a unit type, much as it is proposed here. That C and C++ have a <code>void</code>
 type that is not instantiable is incidental to its original use, but 
the limitations have surfaced over time. Separate from C and C++, at 
least one modern, mainstream language has a <code>void</code> type that is a <code>Regular</code> unit type -- the Swift programming language's <code>void</code> type, called <code>Void</code>, is both instantiable and an alias of the language's empty tuple type.<sup><a href="#References_Swift">[5]</a></sup> Apart from Swift, several other language provide such a void-like unit type, including Rust<sup><a href="#References_Rust">[6]</a></sup> and Haskell<sup><a href="#References_Haskell">[7]</a></sup> via <code>()</code>, and Python<sup><a href="#References_Python">[8]</a></sup> via <code>NoneType</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="Overview">Overview</a></h3>

<h4><a id="ThinkingAboutVoid">Thinking about Void</a></h4>

<p>Presented below is a <code>struct</code> definition that is analogous to what is proposed for <code>void</code> in this paper. The actual definition is not a <code>class</code> type, but this serves as a fairly accurate approximation of what is proposed and how developers can think about <code>void</code>. What should be noticed is that this can be thought of as adding functionality to the existing <code>void</code>
 type, much like adding a special member function to any other existing 
type that didn't have it before, such as adding a move constructor to a 
previously non-copyable type. This comparison is not entirely analogous 
because <code>void</code> is currently no ordinary type, but it is a reasonable, informal description, with details covered later.</p>

<h3><a id="Considerations">Considerations</a></h3>

<h4><a id="UnaryVoid">Unary Functions Taking Void</a></h4>

<p>As <code>void</code> becomes a <code>Regular</code> type, it is 
essential that it is allowed as a function parameter type, just like any
 other object type in the language. Without that it is not suitable in 
generic code, as seen in the logging and <code>std::promise</code> examples. This, however, brings about one minor subtlety. Syntactically, in current C++, a type such as <code>int(void)</code> is valid yet is not a function taking <code>void</code>
 as a parameter. Instead, it is a function taking no parameters. In 
other words, even though it is syntactically different it specifies the 
same type as <code>int()</code>. This is obvious, but it means that we 
would not be able to reclaim that syntax without causing a large amount 
of breaks to existing code.</p>

<p>The suggested solution to this problem is to not reclaim this syntax, at least not at this time, though only when the <code>void</code> type is not a dependent type. Importantly, we can and should use this syntax when <code>void</code>
 is dependent, as is explicitly suggested in this proposal, and is 
thankfully not allowed as a means to specify a nullary function in the 
present state of the language. Because of that, it is very unlikely 
(though still possible in hypothetical, contrived cases mentioned later)
 that such a change would break existing code. The reason why it is 
important that we allow this syntax in a dependent context is because 
this is precisely where it matters to generic code. By utilizing the 
syntax in this context, we have little-to-no chance of breaking any 
existing code while also allowing for generic code to be written in a 
way that does not need to specialize or go through indirection in the 
event that <code>void</code> happens to show up as a dependent type.</p>

<p>This leaves us with one question, though. If, when in a non-dependent context, you cannot declare a unary function that takes a <code>void</code>
 parameter using this syntax, how exactly would you specify such a 
function type? There are multiple options, but ultimately it is proposed
 here that users either specify the <code>void</code> parameter type 
with cv-qualification, which is not valid in this context in current 
C++, or alternatively they can simply give the parameter a name, which 
is also not currently allowed. Both of these solutions are specified as a
 part of this proposal. Rationale for why this seemingly subtle syntax 
is the preferred solution over alternatives is presented later.</p>

<p>Finally, it deserves to be repeated that this quirkiness is only required when the function in question takes <i>exactly</i> one parameter, where that parameter is <code>void</code>, and where that <code>void</code>
 is not a dependent type. If the function type takes multiple 
parameters, then the user needs to do nothing special. Similarly, if the
 <code>void</code> type is dependent, the user also needs to do nothing 
special. This only would affect a small amount of yet-to-be-written code
 that only a certain class of users would ever want to write, and it 
does not at all negatively affect the simplicity of writing generic 
code.

</p><h4><a id="SFINAE">Substitution Failure Is Not an Error</a></h4>

<p>While mostly theoretical, there are potentially SFINAE (Substitution 
Failure Is Not an Error) exploits that might be in use that could take 
advantage of <code>void</code>'s properties, such as its inability to be
 used as a function parameter type in a dependent context, and its 
inability to be used in a <code>sizeof</code> expression. At the very 
least, such exploits are not known to have been used in standard library
 implementations nor have they been encouraged in Boost. It is suspected
 that such properties are exploited rarely, if it all, and in those few 
cases if and where they are exploited, there already exist drop-in 
alternatives via other forms of SFINAE exploits. Note that the <code>sizeof</code>
 trick that is or was frequently used when defining metafunction traits 
is distinct from what is described here and would not be affected. 
Similarly, <code>std::enable_if</code> is not affected by this.</p>

<h2><a id="Alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>

<p>The solution that is proposed was arrived at after carefully 
considering possible alternatives. Notable suggestions from other 
parties are presented below.

</p><h3><a id="LibraryBasedSolutions">Library-Based Solutions</a></h3>

<p>As described in the motivation section, the current way that generic code deals with <code>void</code>
 is by special-casing, often through helper types and templates. It has 
been suggested that we possibly consider standardizing helper templates 
that ease dealing with <code>void</code> in generic code. The problems 
with this are that such facilities are both complicated to specify and 
require people writing generic code to actually know about and use those
 facilities. When and why to use them is subtle. Readers of that code 
who are not familiar with the problem are also baffled by the 
subtleties. By simply making <code>void</code> an object type, we solve 
our problems completely and in a way that is easy for users to utilize, 
and also easier to specify fully and properly in the standard when 
compared to a complicated set of library facilities.</p>

<p>To stress this, as a generic programmer I have used a variety of library-based techniques over the years to help deal with <code>void</code>.
 The results of such techniques, while "better" than handling each case 
individually, are still not for the faint of heart due to the dependence
 on advanced C++ techniques and the fact that those techniques need to 
be explicitly employed by the developer of the generic code. A brief 
outline of the most successful of those techniques, in my experience, 
revolves around the following methodology:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduce a <code>Void</code> type that is just a <code>Regular</code> unit type.</li>
<li>Introduce metafunctions and high-order functions that are already special-cased for <code>void</code>.
<ul>
<li>A metafunction that is an identity metafunction for all types except <code>cv-void</code>, in which case it converts to <code>cv-Void</code></li>
<li>The inverse of the above metafunction</li>
<li>A version of <code>std::invoke</code> that returns <code>Void</code> instead of <code>void</code> when invoking a <code>Callable</code> that returns <code>void</code></li>
<li>A high-order function that takes a unary or nullary function "F" and
 a separate function "I" to invoke, then invokes "F" with the result of 
"I", unless "I" returns <code>void</code> or "F" is only able to be 
invoked with no arguments, in which case, "I" is invoked followed by "F"
 being invoked with no arguments.</li>
<li><i>Other, more obscure high-order functions</i></li>
</ul>
</li><li>Write the bulk of the internals of generic code as normal -- do not try to account for <code>void</code>.</li>
<li>At the interfaces between the generic code and the user, use the 
aforementioned metafunctions and high-order functions to avoid explicit 
branching and top-level specialization.</li>
<li>Continue special-casing in the remaining places where the library-facilities aren't enough.</li>
</ol>

<p>As was warned, the technique is not pretty, and certainly not helpful
 to average Joe programmer. While it successfully removes redundancy, 
most specialization in high-level code, and other types of errors, it 
makes interfaces of the code pretty much unreadable. It also requires an
 understanding of advanced techniques in C++. Because we want/need to 
isolate the user from this helper <code>Void</code> type, the interfaces that we produce are just as difficult to use from other generic code as existing interfaces (such as <code>set_value</code> of <code>std::promise&lt;void&gt;</code>) unless we also provide <code>Void</code>-aware interfaces.</p>

<p>No one wants to write or read code like this and we shouldn't encourage it if there is a proper, language-level solution.</p>

<h3><a id="PartialVoid">Void as <i>Almost</i> an Object</a></h3>

<p>The idea here is that instead of making <code>void</code> an object 
type, we instead just make it act a little bit like one in certain 
contexts. The proclaimed rationale for this approach is that we 
introduce fewer changes to the meaning of <code>void</code> so as to minimize breakages and to not make <code>void</code> do more than is necessary. For instance, it was suggested that we make it possible to create an instance of <code>void</code> on the stack, but not be able to pass it to a function as an argument, or make an array or tuple that contains a <code>void</code> element. While the intention here is in the right place, the rationale is flawed in several ways:
</p><ul>
  <li>By just making <code>void</code> <i>almost</i> an object, we'd only be trading some special-casing in generic code for other special-casing.</li>
  <li>The changes to the standard that would make <code>void</code> an object are simpler to specify than trying to make <code>void</code> <i>almost</i> an object type with special rules.</li>
  <li>All of the functionality of a <code>Regular</code> type really is 
beneficial, since function result types are often worked with in ways 
that have such constraints in generic code.</li>
  <li>No real world examples have been provided where such a 
specification would at all reduce breakage to existing code when 
compared to making the full change that is proposed in this paper. 
Making void <i>almost</i> an object could, however, scatter the complete
 changes across multiple standards, leaving the language with 
unnecessarily subtle differences between iterations with no discernible 
benefit.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="NewVoid">An Entirely New Void Type</a></h3>

<p>Also suggested was the possibility of introducing a new type to the language, separate from <code>void</code>, that behaves in the way that this proposal specifies the existing <code>void</code>
 type should behave. The idea of this solution is that people who want 
such a monostate type can opt-in for it, leaving the existing <code>void</code>
 type unchanged. This initially may seem like a reasonable solution, but
 it fails to actually solve the generic programming problem since <i>users</i>
 of the generic code would be the ones who would be required to now take
 advantage of that new type. Library developers would still need to 
special-case for <code>void</code> in practice because of this.</p>

<h3><a id="ExplicitVoid">Explicit Void</a></h3>
<p>As described earlier, this proposal recommends using <i>cv</i>-<code>void</code> or a named <code>void</code> parameter for representing a unary function with a <code>void</code> parameter when <code>void</code> is not dependent. One alternative to using <i>cv-void</i> or a named <code>void</code> parameter for representing a unary function having a <code>void</code>
 parameter is to instead propose an entirely new syntax for that case. 
For instance, one possiblity is to allow a declaration such as:
</p><pre style="color:#000000;background:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">void</span> foo<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">explicit</span> <span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">void</span><span style="color:#808030; ">)</span> <span style="color:#800080; ">{</span><span style="color:#800080; ">}</span>
</pre>

<p>At first this may seem like a good idea since it makes the difference between it and the current meaning of a <code>void</code> parameter list more drastic, however it has a few drawbacks:
</p><ul>
  <li>It introduces a syntax that would only work for <code>void</code> (unless it were also proposed to work for other types for the sake of consistency).</li>
  <li>It is a more complex change as it requires altering the language grammar.</li>
  <li>It introduces a syntax that may be deprecated in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point is a bit subtle, though it may be the most important. 
Ultimately, in a future standard it would be a simplification to the 
langauge to make a parameter-list consisting of a single, unnamed, 
cv-unqualified <code>void</code> parameter behave no different from most
 other object types. That is to say, that syntax would eventually be 
used to declare a unary function taking a parameter of type <code>void</code>.
 It is not recommended that we update the meaning of that syntax 
immediately as a part of this proposal because that would change the 
meaning of a large body of existing code in a way that would cause 
breakages, including sometimes in ways that only change behavior of 
existing programs at runtime. If, in the meantime, we were to introduce 
an entirely new syntax and alter the language grammar solely to allow 
the declaration of a parameter of type <code>void</code>, we'd likely want to eventually deprecate and remove <i>that</i> syntax once the desired syntax is ripe to be used. On the other hand, if in the time being we only use cv-qualified <code>void</code> or a named <code>void</code> parameter to represent an actual <code>void</code> parameter, then if/when the current meaning of <code>void</code> is to finally be replaced, any code that declared a single parameter of type <code>void</code>
 in the currently proposed manner would not need to be updated, since 
even then it would remain as a valid way to declare such a parameter 
(just as it is a valid way in the language right now to declare 
parameters of non-<code>void</code> type).</p>

<p>So, at the cost of being a little bit subtle in newly-written code, 
we avoid cluttering the language with new syntax and also avoid having 
to remove a special syntax at some point in the future. It is a simpler 
change in the language to make right now, in addition to being better in
 the long term.</p>

<h3><a id="PartialAlias">Partial-Alias of Void</a></h3>

<p>Similar to the idea of creating a separate <code>void</code> type is the idea of introducing a "partial alias" for <code>void</code> that behaves in the manner suggested by this proposal, but is otherwise treated as an alias of <code>void</code> in all or most other ways (<code>template</code> specializations on <code>void</code> and the new alias would be the same, for example). The rationale given for this is that it avoids changing the meaning of <code>void</code>,
 but may provide a route toward solving some problems that have been 
presented. This would be a very unique addition to the language that 
makes the standard more complicated and difficult to learn. It also has 
odd implications and raises some questions. Most importantly, if 
dependent <code>void</code> does not behave in the manner proposed by 
this paper, then the motivating cases of this proposal are not actually 
covered. If dependent <code>void</code> <i>does</i> behave in a manner consistent with this paper, there will still be a change in meaning for <code>void</code>
 when the type is dependent, which is what the "partial alias" 
suggestion is trying to avoid. At that point, the "partial alias" option
 is in many ways equivalent to the "explicit void" option, but with a 
new special kind of type/alias and the complexity that comes with it.</p>

<h3><a id="ParameterCollapsing">Parameter Collapsing</a></h3>

<p>In discussions, it has been suggested by multiple parties independently to consider "collapsing" <code>void</code> parameters in a function type in a way that makes a function type specified as <code>void (int, void)</code> equivalent to the function type <code>void (int)</code>. Similarly, when invoking a function and passing a <code>void</code>
 expression as an argument, that argument would instead be ignored and 
the invocation would actually be passing one less argument than it would
 appear. Though intially this might not look problematic, not only does 
it keep <code>void</code> as a special type with special rules that can 
really make it difficult to write certain generic code, but it also 
introduces subtle ambiguities or other errors. For example:</p>

<pre style="color:#000000;background:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">enum</span> <span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">class</span> log_option <span style="color:#800080; ">{</span> simple<span style="color:#808030; ">,</span> verbose <span style="color:#800080; ">}</span><span style="color:#800080; ">;</span>

<span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">template</span><span style="color:#800080; ">&lt;</span><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">class</span> T<span style="color:#800080; ">&gt;</span>

<h2><a id="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

<h3><a id="SpecialCasing">Doesn't This Proposal Introduce <i>More</i> Special-Casing for <code>void</code>?</a></h3>

No. This is most easily seen by examining the <a href="#BasicChanges">tables of changes</a> or the <a href="#Proposal">specification</a>.
 What should be noticed is that while the changes that this proposal 
introduces provide more consistency with existing types, they do not 
introduce any new inconsistencies that didn't already exist. Not only is
 the type system more consistent because of this, but that fact is 
reflected in the wording in the standard, where the vast majority of the
 changes are simply removals of existing special cases.

<h3><a id="SizeZero">Why Isn't <code>sizeof(void)</code> Equal to <code>0</code>?</a></h3>

<p>One suggestion that has repeatedly come up is to have <code>sizeof(void)</code> report <code>0</code>
 and to allow multiple instances to share the same address. This would 
prevent users from having to use tricks akin to the empty base 
optimization in order to make more optimal usage of memory. Ideally, 
this would be the case, however such a change to the language is both 
vast and out of scope of the proposal. Allowing a type to have a <code>0</code>
 size and to allow separate instances to share an address implies 
drastic and subtle breaking changes to existing code. For instance, if 
you were to make an array of such a <code>void</code> type, a pointer, 
at least in the traditional sense, would no longer be able to be used as
 an iterator into that array (notably meaning that generic code which 
relies on this would now fail for such a size <code>0</code> type). As well, any code that relies on an object's type and address as unique would fail for <code>void</code> types, even though it is otherwise perfectly acceptable. Finally, if such a size were permitted for <code>void</code>, it should really be allowed for <i>any</i> type, including user-defined types. Having a special rule for <code>void</code> would make one more thing to have to think about and deal with differently for <code>void</code> types. Instead, this proposal opts to leave the size of <code>void</code> unspecified and thereby governed by existing language rules. In practice, it is expected that <code>void</code> will likely be size <code>1</code> in most implementations, though this is not required. If an eventual change were made to the language to allow for size <code>0</code> types, then <code>void</code> would be able to implicitly take advantage of that.</p>

<h3><a id="EnableIf">Does This Break <code>std::enable_if</code>?</a></h3>

<p>No. The uses of <code>std::enable_if</code> do not depend on the uniqueness of the <code>void</code> type. As described <a href="#SFINAE">earlier</a>, while there are contrived, hypothetical SFINAE exploitations separate from <code>std::enable_if</code>
 that can break, they are not ones endorsed by the standard library nor 
are they encouraged by Boost. If such exploits turn out to be used, 
there are trivial replacements in the form of alternative SFINAE 
exploits.</p>

<p></p><h4><a id="ABI">In Practice, Would This Break ABI Compatibility?</a></h4>

<p>No. Because we are changing the <code>void</code> type, it might 
initially seem as though we'd be breaking compatibility with existing, 
prebuilt libraries, including C libraries. This is untrue. Our 
alterations do not change the meaning of existing, valid function 
declarations, nor do they add any state to the <code>void</code> type that needs to be communicated. The fact that functions with the return type <code>void</code> now return objects from the point of view of those who use C++ does not affect this.</p>

<h3><a id="ConstexprIf">Doesn't <code>constexpr_if</code> Make Branching for <code>void</code> Easier?</a></h3>

<p>With the acceptance of <code>constexpr_if</code><sup><a href="#References_ConstexprIf">[9]</a></sup>,
 some have voiced that the problems this paper solves may already have 
an upcoming solution. The idea is that because programmers can now more 
easily branch off in a function template definition explicitly via <code>constexpr_if</code> based on whether or not a type is <i>cv</i> <code>void</code>, the changes to <code>void</code> proposed in this paper would not be necessary. Unfortunately, while <code>constpexpr_if</code> does aid in turning specializations into more imperative branching, the goal of making <code>void</code> a <code>Regular</code> type is to make specializations and branching entirely <i>unnecessary</i>, having templates work correctly with <code>void</code> without any effort taken by the developer of that template.</p>


<h3><a id="NoSense">Isn't It Illogical to Support <i>some-operation</i> for <code>void</code>?</a></h3>

<p>In several instances, people have asked whether or not certain operations or compound types make sense for <code>void</code>
 and wonder why they are allowed. These concerns usually come down to a 
belief that because a particular operation would effectively be a no-op,
 it would be illogical for such an operation to appear in code, since it
 would likely be a user-error. The issues with such a belief are 
immediately evident for those who write generic code, as it is unable to
 be known whether or not a logical operation actually <i>does</i> 
anything, and so this paper will not go into too much detail on that 
aspect. Some examples of functionality that people have questioned the 
need for with respect to <code>void</code> are as follows (not a complete list):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making an instance of <code>void</code>.</li>
  <li>Making an array of <code>void</code>.</li>
  <li>Making a tuple that contains a <code>void</code> element.</li>
  <li>Copying a <code>void</code> object.</li>
  <li>Passing a <code>void</code> object as a function argument.</li>
  <li>Forming a reference to <code>void</code>.</li>
  <li>Using pointer arithmetic on a pointer to <code>void</code>.</li>
  <li>Comparing instances of <code>void</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these points are already covered in the motivation section, 
though perhaps deserving of more explicit mention are the array, tuple, 
reference, and pointer arithmetic cases. These can all be rather 
concisely explained with a simple code example that invokes <i>N</i> Callables in generic code, aggregating the results into an array:</p>

<pre style="color:#000000;background:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#696969; ">// Execute N functions with the same return type, </span>

<span style="color:#800080; ">}</span>
</pre>

<p>In generic code, <code>void</code> can very easily show up as a 
dependent result type. Here, it should be clear that there is nothing 
illogical about producing an aggregate of function results given that 
there is nothing illogical about dealing with a single result. 
Similarly, just as with any other array in C++, one would expect a 
pointer to an element of an array of <code>void</code> to act as a valid iterator into the array (and this also implies pointer arithmetic), otherwise <code>void</code> would fail to work for a large body of generic code.</p>

<p>The above example applies to <code>std::tuple</code>, just the same, 
if you remove the restriction of the functions all having the same 
return type. Now consider the signature of the functions involved when 
creating an instance of that tuple type, and the function types that 
arise when accessing that tuple — you will find that references to <code>void</code> and <code>void</code> parameters may naturally pop up, and there is no problem with this. As specified in this proposal, <code>void</code>
 is simply an object type like any other object type. This type just 
happens to only be able to represent a unit set of values (it would be a
 monostate type). This would not even be the first of such types to 
exist in the language (see <code>std::nullptr_t</code> as one such example, with multiple others exist in various proposals).</p>

<h3><a id="MultipleReturnValues">Doesn't This Remove the Notion of "No Result?"</a></h3>

<p>No.</p>

<p>One concern that has been brought up is that by making <code>void</code>
 an object type, we'd be removing the ability in the language to 
represent a function with no result and be left with a language that can
 only represent functions with exactly one result. Further, it has been 
suggested that we should go in the other direction, and instead of 
removing the current meaning of <code>void</code>, we should directly support the notion of a function with multiple results, including no results, and to have <code>void</code>
 represent such a lack of result. Though this may sound sensible at 
first, it actually ends up being an entirely orthogonal concern that is 
not in conflict with the changes to <code>void</code> that are proposed here.</p>

<p>Before going further into the details, it should first be stressed 
that functions in C++ can already represent any number of results, 
including what many refer to as "none," by way of containers, tuples, 
and ranges, just as functions in mathematics have the ability to 
represent such results even though, strictly speaking, the application 
of a function in mathematics maps to one result. A language-level 
multiple return value facility would only alter the way in which users 
can opt to <i>convey</i> multiple results and how such results are 
operated on syntactically. Such a facility may prove to be valuable for 
the language, as it might allow for more opportunities to elide copies 
and moves of objects that are currently unable to be elided, it may make
 it easier to expand out results as separate arguments to function calls
 in a single expression, and it may be able to reduce compile times when
 compared to existing alternatives. Again, though, these benefits are 
not at all in conflict with the contents of this proposal.</p>

<p>Though this is all hypothetical as there is no current proposal for 
actually providing the language with a multiple return value facility, 
we can reason about the desirable properties of such a facility if one 
were formally proposed. As one quickly sees, with such a facility, there
 are still very compelling reasons to allow a representation of multiple
 results as a single object that can be passed around and manipulated as
 a whole, much like one does with a <code>std::tuple</code>, and just as is proposed in this paper regarding <code>void</code> (note, too, that in C++, a <code>std::tuple&lt;&gt;</code> with no template arguments is a <code>Regular</code> type, and this is extremely important for generic code). For example, imagine that you wish to create a <code>std::future</code> that corresponds to the result of some nullary function <code>func</code>. In current C++, this type may be specified as <code>std::future&lt;decltype(func())&gt;</code>. Notably, this works in current C++ even for a <code>void</code> return type. If the language had a way to directly represent a function with <i>N</i> different return values, what would a user expect from such a <code>std::future</code> instantiation? If the result of the function call is not implicitly dealt with as a single entity, regardless of the value of <i>N</i>,
 but instead is dealt with as something more akin to a variadic list of 
return types, that bit of code either wouldn't compile, or, if expanded,
 would pass <i>N</i> different type arguments to <code>std::future</code> (and the 0, or <code>void</code> case, would now fail, unless we were to maintain an inconsistency for such a return type).</p>

<p>If the result type were not treated as a single entity, in order to make such a <code>std::future</code> instantiation work for all <i>N</i> in this case the user would likely just always manually bind the results together into a tuple before forming the <code>std::future</code>
 template argument. A generic high-order function that needs to create 
such a facility would likely now always bind the result of the call to a
 tuple. Unfortunately, this also affects usage of the result when 
retrieved from the <code>std::future</code>. In other words, while 
retrieving the results from the function directly, the user would get 
some kind of multiple-return-value construct, retrieving the results 
from the <code>std::future</code> would yield a tuple type. The 
developer would now have to expand out that tuple in order to use it in 
places that the result of the original function would be usable.</p>

<p>Perhaps, alternatively, this hypothetical multiple return value 
proposal that doesn't represent the multiple results as a single entity 
would also introduce changes to templates, such as <code>std::future</code>, to make the template parameter list variadic. Then, users could expand their result type as <i>N</i> template arguments and the return value of <code>get()</code>
 could directly result in the language-level multiple return value 
facility. Not only would this make things much more complicated at the 
library level, but <code>std::future</code> is not at all special here. 
Any time you instantiate a template with the result type of a function, 
this issue would show up, and the set of templates that you may 
instantiate in this manner is potentially any template that has a 
type-template-parameter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you directly represent the multiple return 
value facility as a single object, dealing with such an entity is 
consistent with existing return types and has no negative implications 
regarding generic code. What you'd actually have, in this case, is a 
language-level tuple type, and just like with <code>std::tuple</code>, a tuple that contains no elements is still, itself a <code>Regular</code> type, which is important for generic code.</p>

<p>So, briefly, even if we were to have direct support for multiple 
return values in the language, it would be beneficial for such a feature
 to be synonymous with direct, language-level tuple support in that the 
return value itself could be directly used as a single object. <i>Not</i>
 treating such a facility in this manner would actually make generic 
code more difficult to write correctly as opposed to less difficult. 
Further, just as is the case with <code>std::tuple&lt;&gt;</code>, such an "empty" set of results should be able to be dealt with like any other case and should be a <code>Regular</code> type. In the presence of such a mutliple return value facility using some intrinsic tuple type, the <code>void</code> type could even hypothetically be specified to be an alias of such an empty tuple, and so an assertion that the <code>void</code> type of this proposal would be inconsistent with the <code>void</code>
 type in the presence of a hypothetical multiple return value facility 
is incorrect (in fact, this is exactly what the Swift programming 
language does). In either case, having a <code>Regular</code> <code>void</code> type is just as compelling.</p>

<h3><a id="Ideologies">Isn't This a Change to the <i>Meaning</i> of <code>void</code>?</a></h3>

<p>No? Yes? It depends on how you personally choose to think about <code>void</code> in current C++</p>.
 This ideological concern is both subjective and irrelevant to how code 
is written and to what values can be represented in a C++ program. While
 it is true that the mental model some developers have may change, this 
would not at all adversely affect their code, and on the contrary, this 
would make it easier to correctly write high-order functions that 
encounter <code>void</code> as a dependent type. While a particularly programmer can maintain a world view where <code>void</code>
 is a totally different "kind" of type, as the current standard 
represents it, this is a more complicated world view than the 
alternative. It is analogous in mathematics to treating <code>0</code> 
as something other than a number. You can have a world view such as 
that, as people did for many years, but it certainly does not make 
anything easier to reason about.<p></p>

<p>Taking a step back, we should not let raw intuitions guide our view 
of language design or of abstraction in general, whether in programming 
or in other disciplines. Rather, we should lift our abstractions from 
introspection of the world and of the solutions that we discover. At 
that point, if there is inconsistency between reality and our 
intuitions, then our <i>intuitions</i> are what are in error. It only hinders progress to deny that.</p> 

<h2><a id="Proposal">Proposed Solution</a></h2>
<p>The <code>void</code> type is updated to be an object type with care 
taken to minimize breaking changes to existing code. This implies a 
considerable number of changes to the standard, although most of those 
changes are simplifications due to the removal of redundant statements 
mentioning <code>void</code>, which are now implicitly covered by the fact that <code>void</code> is a complete object type that is considered a scalar. Additional updates are planned for the LEWG<sup><a href="#References_VoidFuture">[2]</a><a href="#References_VoidStdLib">[3]</a></sup>, but they are outside of the scope of this proposal and are predicated on the viability of the language changes presented here.</p>

<h2><a id="ChangeHistory">Change History</a></h2>

<p>This proposal is a revision of P0146r0<sup><a href="#References_R0">[11]</a></sup>,
 which was a part of the September 2015 mailing. Changes that this 
proposal adds include a high-level overview section, more rationale, 
references to existing langauges that offer an instantiable <code>void</code> type, more analysis of alternatives, and a compatibility section to <b>[diff.cpp14]</b>. It also no longer suggests deprecating the existing usage of <code>T(void)</code>
 as a means to specify a nullary function, due to concerns that we'd 
never actually be able to remove that meaning in a future standard, 
particularly due to C compatibility. This update also fixes the 
oversight of not fully specifying initialization of <code>void</code> 
now that it is an object type, and it also fixes the oversight of not 
explicitly defining the behavior when flowing off of the end of a 
function that returns a <code>void</code> type without an explicit return statement (it is now explicitly defined to be valid and produces a value-initialized <code>void</code>).</p>

<p>Changes to the standard have now also been updated to be relative to N4567<sup><a href="#References_N4567">[10]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2><a id="Acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a></h2>
<p>Though a change to the language such as this has been discussed 
informally by several in the past, particularly by Sean Parent, the 
direct motivation for this proposal was a discussion<sup><a href="#References_AVoV">[12]</a></sup>
 in the std-proposals group (a thread that the author of this proposal 
did not start). Many suggestions and alternatives mentioned in this 
proposal come from those who took part in that discussion.</p>
<p>In addition to those mentioned above, Richard Smith provided support 
and early feedback during the writing of this proposal and its revision,
 and provides continued aid in the specification of wording. I also 
hijacked his formatting for use in this document. Also thanks to Sean 
Parent and David Sankel, who provided feedback on drafts of this 
revision.</p>
