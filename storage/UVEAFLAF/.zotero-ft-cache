Documentation
Port to ECMAScript 6 (version 2.10.0)

Moment 2.10.0 does not bring any new features, but the code is now written in ECMAScript 6 modules and placed inside src/ . Previously moment.js , locale/*.js and test/moment/*.js , test/locale/*.js contained the source of the project. Now the source is in src/ , temporary build (ECMAScript 5) files are placed under build/umd/ (for running tests during development), and the moment.js and locale/*.js files are updated only on release.

If you want to use a particular revision of the code, make sure to run grunt transpile update-index , so moment.js and locales/*.js are synced with src/* . We might place that in a commit hook in the future.
Upgrading to 2.0.0

There are a number of small backwards incompatible changes with version 2.0.0. See the full descriptions here

    Changed language ordinal method to return the number + ordinal instead of just the ordinal.

    Changed two digit year parsing cutoff to match strptime.

    Removed moment#sod and moment#eod in favor of moment#startOf and moment#endOf .

    Removed moment.humanizeDuration() in favor of moment.duration().humanize() .

    Removed the lang data objects from the top level namespace.

    Duplicate Date passed to moment() instead of referencing it.
