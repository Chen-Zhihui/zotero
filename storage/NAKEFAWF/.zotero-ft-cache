(Version 0.3, Last updated :2017.02.21)
1.Introduction

This is tensorflow implementation of the YOLO:Real-Time Object Detection

It can only do predictions using pretrained YOLO_small & YOLO_tiny network for now.

(+ YOLO_face detector from https://github.com/quanhua92/darknet )

I extracted weight values from darknet's (.weight) files.

My code does not support training. Use darknet for training.

Original code(C implementation) & paper : http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
2.Install

(1) Download code

(2) Download YOLO weight file from

YOLO_small : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2JbaJSrWLpza08yS2FSUnV2dlE/view?usp=sharing

YOLO_tiny : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2JbaJSrWLpza0FtQlc3ejhMTTA/view?usp=sharing

YOLO_face : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2JbaJSrWLpzMzR5eURGN2dMTk0/view?usp=sharing

(3) Put the 'YOLO_(version).ckpt' in the 'weight' folder of downloaded code
3.Usage

(1) direct usage with default settings (display on console, show output image, no output file writing)

 python YOLO_(small or tiny)_tf.py -fromfile (input image filename)  

(2) direct usage with custom settings

 python YOLO_(small or tiny)_tf.py argvs where argvs are -fromfile (input image filename) : input image file -disp_console (0 or 1) : whether display results on terminal or not -imshow (0 or 1) : whether display result image or not -tofile_img (output image filename) : output image file -tofile_txt (output txt filename) : output text file (contains class, x, y, w, h, probability)  

(3) import on other scripts

 import YOLO_(small or tiny)_tf yolo = YOLO_(small or tiny)_tf.YOLO_TF() yolo.disp_console = (True or False, default = True) yolo.imshow = (True or False, default = True) yolo.tofile_img = (output image filename) yolo.tofile_txt = (output txt filename) yolo.filewrite_img = (True or False, default = False) yolo.filewrite_txt = (True of False, default = False) yolo.detect_from_file(filename) yolo.detect_from_cvmat(cvmat)  

4.Requirements

    Tensorflow
    Opencv2

5.Copyright

According to the LICENSE file of the original code,

    Me and original author hold no liability for any damages
    Do not use this on commercial!

6.Changelog

2016/02/15 : First upload!

2016/02/16 : Added YOLO_tiny, Fixed bug that ignores one of the boxes in grid when both boxes detected valid objects

2016/08/26 : Uploaded weight file converter! (darknet weight -> tensorflow ckpt)

2017/02/21 : Added YOLO_face (Thanks https://github.com/quanhua92/darknet )
