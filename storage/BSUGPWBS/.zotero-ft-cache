Updates

    Oct 13, 2016
        A demo for extracting deep feature by the given model is provided.
    Oct 12, 2016
        The links of face model and features on LFW are available.
        model: google drive baidu skydrive
        feature: google drive baidu skydrive
        The training prototxt of toy example on MNIST are released.
    Otc 9, 2016
        The code and training prototxt for our ECCV16 paper are released.
        If you train our Network on CAISA-WebFace , the expected verification performance of SINGLE MODEL on LFW should be ~99% .

Train_Model

    The Installation completely the same as Caffe . Please follow the installation instructions . Make sure you have correctly installed before using our code.

    Download the face dataset for training, e.g. CAISA-WebFace , VGG-Face , MS-Celeb-1M , MegaFace .

    Preprocess the training face images, including detection, alignment, etc. Here we strongly recommend MTCNN , which is an effective and efficient open-source tool for face detection and alignment.

    Creat list for training set and validation set. Place them in face_example/data/

    Specify your data source for train & val

     layer { name: "data" type: "ImageData" top: "data" top: "label" image_data_param { source: "face_example/data/###your_list###" } }  

    Specify the number of subject in FC6 layer

     layer { name: "fc6" type: "InnerProduct" bottom: "fc5" top: "fc6" inner_product_param { num_output: ##number## } }  

    Specify the loss weight and the number of subject in center loss layer

     layer { name: "center_loss" type: "CenterLoss" bottom: "fc5" bottom: "label" top: "center_loss" loss_weight: ##weight## center_loss_param { num_output: ##number## } }  

    Train model

     cd $CAFFE-FACE_ROOT ./build/tools/caffe train -solver face_example/face_solver.prototxt -gpu X,Y  

Extract_DeepFeature

    Compile matcaffe by make matcaffe

    Specify the correspinding paths in face_example/extractDeepFeature.m

     addpath('path_to_matCaffe/matlab'); model = 'path_to_deploy/face_deploy.prototxt'; weights = 'path_to_model/face_model.caffemodel'; image = imread('path_to_image/Jennifer_Aniston_0016.jpg');  

    Run extractDeepFeature.m in Matlab
