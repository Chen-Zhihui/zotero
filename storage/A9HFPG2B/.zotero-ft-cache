ZIM is a perfectly suited file format to store Wikipedia on a USB stick

The openZIM project proposes offline storage solutions for content coming from the Web. The project has two different targets:

    Definition of the ZIM file format : an open and standardized file format,
    Implementation of the zimlib : an open source ( GPLv2 ) implementation of the ZIM file format.

See our mission statement for more details

The openZIM project was launched by Wikimedia CH (Switzerland) and is actively supported by the Wikimedia Foundation .
