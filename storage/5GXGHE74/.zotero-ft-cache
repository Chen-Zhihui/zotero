What's New

    2016/11/30 v1.0.0a3 is released!
    2016/9/14 tiny-dnn v1.0.0alpha is released!
    2016/8/7 tiny-dnn is now moved to organization account, and renamed into tiny-dnn :)
    2016/7/27 tiny-dnn v0.1.1 released!

Features

    Reasonably fast, without GPU:
        With TBB threading and SSE/AVX vectorization.
        98.8% accuracy on MNIST in 13 minutes training (@Core i7-3520M).
    Portable & header-only:
        Runs anywhere as long as you have a compiler which supports C++14.
        Just include tiny_dnn.h and write your model in C++. There is nothing to install.
    Easy to integrate with real applications:
        No output to stdout/stderr.
        A constant throughput (simple parallelization model, no garbage collection).
        Works without throwing an exception.
        Can import caffe's model .
    Simply implemented:
        A good library for learning neural networks.

Dependencies

Nothing. All you need is a C++14 compiler (gcc 4.9+, clang 3.6+ or VS 2015+).
Build

tiny-dnn is header-only, so there's nothing to build . If you want to execute sample program or unit tests, you need to install cmake and type the following commands:

 cmake . -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON make  

Then change to examples directory and run executable files.

If you would like to use IDE like Visual Studio or Xcode, you can also use cmake to generate corresponding files:

 cmake . -G "Xcode" # for Xcode users cmake . -G "NMake Makefiles" # for Windows Visual Studio users  

Then open .sln file in visual studio and build(on windows/msvc), or type make command(on linux/mac/windows-mingw).

Some cmake options are available:
options 	description 	default 	additional requirements to use
USE_TBB 	Use Intel TBB for parallelization 	OFF 1 	Intel TBB
USE_OMP 	Use OpenMP for parallelization 	OFF 1 	OpenMP Compiler
USE_SSE 	Use Intel SSE instruction set 	ON 	Intel CPU which supports SSE
USE_AVX 	Use Intel AVX instruction set 	ON 	Intel CPU which supports AVX
USE_AVX2 	Build tiny-dnn with AVX2 library support 	OFF 	Intel CPU which supports AVX2
USE_NNPACK 	Use NNPACK for convolution operation 	OFF 	Acceleration package for neural networks on multi-core CPUs
USE_OPENCL 	Enable/Disable OpenCL support (experimental) 	OFF 	The open standard for parallel programming of heterogeneous systems
USE_LIBDNN 	Use Greentea LibDNN for convolution operation with GPU via OpenCL (experimental) 	OFF 	An universal convolution implementation supporting CUDA and OpenCL
USE_SERIALIZER 	Enable model serialization 	ON 2 	-
USE_DOUBLE 	Use double precision computations instead of single precision 	OFF 	-
USE_ASAN 	Use Address Sanitizer 	OFF 	clang or gcc compiler
USE_IMAGE_API 	Enable Image API support 	ON 	-
USE_GEMMLOWP 	Enable gemmlowp support 	OFF 	-
BUILD_TESTS 	Build unit tests 	OFF 3 	-
BUILD_EXAMPLES 	Build example projects 	OFF 	-
BUILD_DOCS 	Build documentation 	OFF 	Doxygen
PROFILE 	Build unit tests 	OFF 	gprof

1 tiny-dnn use C++14 standard library for parallelization by default.

2 If you don't use serialization, you can switch off to speedup compilation time.

3 tiny-dnn uses Google Test as default framework to run unit tests. No pre-installation required, it's automatically downloaded during CMake configuration.

For example, type the following commands if you want to use Intel TBB and build tests:

 cmake -DUSE_TBB=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON . 

Customize configurations

You can edit include/config.h to customize default behavior.
Examples

Construct convolutional neural networks

 # include  " tiny_dnn/tiny_dnn.h "  
using  namespace  tiny_dnn ; 
using  namespace  tiny_dnn ::activation ; 
using  namespace  tiny_dnn ::layers ; 

void  construct_cnn () {
    using  namespace  tiny_dnn ; 

    network<sequential> net;

    // add layers 
    net << conv ( 32 , 32 , 5 , 1 , 6 ) << tanh ()  // in:32x32x1, 5x5conv, 6fmaps 
        << ave_pool ( 28 , 28 , 6 , 2 ) << tanh () // in:28x28x6, 2x2pooling 
        << fc ( 14  * 14  * 6 , 120 ) << tanh ()   // in:14x14x6, out:120 
        << fc ( 120 , 10 );                     // in:120, out:10 

    assert (net. in_data_size () == 32  * 32 );
    assert (net. out_data_size () == 10 );

    // load MNIST dataset 
    std::vector< label_t > train_labels;
    std::vector< vec_t > train_images;

    parse_mnist_labels ( " train-labels.idx1-ubyte "  , &train_labels);
    parse_mnist_images ( " train-images.idx3-ubyte "  , &train_images, - 1.0 , 1.0 , 2 , 2 );

    // declare optimization algorithm 
    adagrad optimizer;

    // train (50-epoch, 30-minibatch) 
    net. train <mse, adagrad>(optimizer, train_images, train_labels, 30 , 50 );

    // save 
    net. save ( " net "  );

    // load 
    // network<sequential> net2; 
    // net2.load("net"); 
}

Construct multi-layer perceptron (mlp)

 # include  " tiny_dnn/tiny_dnn.h "  
using  namespace  tiny_dnn ; 
using  namespace  tiny_dnn ::activation ; 
using  namespace  tiny_dnn ::layers ; 

void  construct_mlp () {
    network<sequential> net;

    net << fc ( 32  * 32 , 300 ) << sigmoid () << fc ( 300 , 10 );

    assert (net. in_data_size () == 32  * 32 );
    assert (net. out_data_size () == 10 );
}

Another way to construct mlp

 # include  " tiny_dnn/tiny_dnn.h "  
using  namespace  tiny_dnn ; 
using  namespace  tiny_dnn ::activation ; 

void  construct_mlp () {
    auto  mynet = make_mlp< tanh >({ 32  * 32 , 300 , 10  });

    assert (mynet. in_data_size () == 32  * 32 );
    assert (mynet. out_data_size () == 10 );
}
