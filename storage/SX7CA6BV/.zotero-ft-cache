For matrices with orthogonality over the real number field, see orthogonal matrix .
For the restriction on the allowed evolution of quantum systems that ensures the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes of any event always equals 1, see unitarity .

In mathematics , a complex square matrix U is unitary if its conjugate transpose U ∗ is also its inverse —that is, if

        U ∗ U = U U ∗ = I , {\displaystyle U^{*}U=UU^{*}=I,} U^{*}U=UU^{*}=I, 

where I is the identity matrix . In physics, especially in quantum mechanics, the Hermitian conjugate of a matrix is denoted by a dagger ( † ) and the equation above becomes

        U † U = U U † = I . {\displaystyle U^{\dagger }U=UU^{\dagger }=I.} U^{\dagger }U=UU^{\dagger }=I. 

The real analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix . Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms , and thus, probability amplitudes .

Properties [ edit ]

For any unitary matrix U of finite size, the following hold:

    Given two complex vectors x and y , multiplication by U preserves their inner product ; that is, ⟨ Ux , Uy ⟩ = ⟨ x , y ⟩ .
    U is normal
    U is diagonalizable ; that is, U is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, as a consequence of the spectral theorem . Thus, U has a decomposition of the form

        U = V D V ∗ {\displaystyle U=VDV^{*}\;} U=VDV^{*}\; 

    where V is unitary and D is diagonal and unitary.

    | d e t ( U ) | = 1 {\displaystyle \left|\mathrm {det} (U)\right|=1} {\displaystyle \left|\mathrm {det} (U)\right|=1} .
    Its eigenspaces are orthogonal.
    U can be written as U  = e i H , where e indicates matrix exponential , i is the imaginary unit, and H is a Hermitian matrix .

For any nonnegative integer n , the set of all n -by- n unitary matrices with matrix multiplication forms a group , called the unitary group U( n ).

Any square matrix with unit Euclidean norm is the average of two unitary matrices. [1]
Equivalent conditions [ edit ]

If U is a square, complex matrix, then the following conditions are equivalent:

    U is unitary.
    U ∗ is unitary.
    U is invertible with U −1 = U ∗ .
    The columns of U form an orthonormal basis of C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} \mathbb {C} ^{n} with respect to the usual inner product.
    The rows of U form an orthonormal basis of C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} \mathbb {C} ^{n} with respect to the usual inner product.
    U is an isometry with respect to the usual norm.
    U is a normal matrix with eigenvalues lying on the unit circle .

Elementary constructions [ edit ]
2 × 2 unitary matrix [ edit ]

The general expression of a 2 × 2 unitary matrix is:

    U = [ a b − e i φ b ∗ e i φ a ∗ ] , | a | 2 + | b | 2 = 1 , {\displaystyle U={\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\-e^{i\varphi }b^{*}&e^{i\varphi }a^{*}\\\end{bmatrix}},\qquad \left|a\right|^{2}+\left|b\right|^{2}=1,} {\displaystyle U={\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\-e^{i\varphi }b^{*}&e^{i\varphi }a^{*}\\\end{bmatrix}},\qquad \left|a\right|^{2}+\left|b\right|^{2}=1,} 

which depends on 4 real parameters (the phase of a , the phase of b , the relative magnitude between a and b , and the angle φ ). The determinant of such a matrix is:

    det ( U ) = e i φ . {\displaystyle \det(U)=e^{i\varphi }.} {\displaystyle \det(U)=e^{i\varphi }.} 

The sub-group of such elements in U where det( U ) = 1 is called the special unitary group SU(2).

The matrix U can also be written in this alternative form:

    U = e i φ / 2 [ e i φ 1 cos ⁡ θ e i φ 2 sin ⁡ θ − e − i φ 2 sin ⁡ θ e − i φ 1 cos ⁡ θ ] , {\displaystyle U=e^{i\varphi /2}{\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\varphi _{1}}\cos \theta &e^{i\varphi _{2}}\sin \theta \\-e^{-i\varphi _{2}}\sin \theta &e^{-i\varphi _{1}}\cos \theta \\\end{bmatrix}},} {\displaystyle U=e^{i\varphi /2}{\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\varphi _{1}}\cos \theta &e^{i\varphi _{2}}\sin \theta \\-e^{-i\varphi _{2}}\sin \theta &e^{-i\varphi _{1}}\cos \theta \\\end{bmatrix}},} 

which, by introducing φ 1 = ψ + Δ and φ 2 = ψ − Δ , takes the following factorization:

    U = e i φ / 2 [ e i ψ 0 0 e − i ψ ] [ cos ⁡ θ sin ⁡ θ − sin ⁡ θ cos ⁡ θ ] [ e i Δ 0 0 e − i Δ ] . {\displaystyle U=e^{i\varphi /2}{\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\psi }&0\\0&e^{-i\psi }\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &\sin \theta \\-\sin \theta &\cos \theta \\\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\Delta }&0\\0&e^{-i\Delta }\end{bmatrix}}.} {\displaystyle U=e^{i\varphi /2}{\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\psi }&0\\0&e^{-i\psi }\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &\sin \theta \\-\sin \theta &\cos \theta \\\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\Delta }&0\\0&e^{-i\Delta }\end{bmatrix}}.} 

This expression highlights the relation between 2 × 2 unitary matrices and 2 × 2 orthogonal matrices of angle θ .

Many other factorizations of a unitary matrix in basic matrices are possible.
