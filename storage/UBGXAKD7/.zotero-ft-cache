OpenNPD

Project of object detection.
Usage:

    Add needed librarys to 3rdpart folder(opencv).

    Make: cd src; make clean; make RELEASE=1; cd .. ;

    Detect example: sh ./script/test_detect_demo.sh

    Training example: Please refer to ./script/npd_train_demo.sh

Note:

    Thereis a npddetect::prescandetect function for faster detection with some lose on recall. Additional parameter stepR refers to pre-scan step size compared to the original scan step size ( float more than 1 ) . The thresR refers to the threshold to reject the window( float in [0-1] ).

Result:

    ROC:

    Speed:

| image size | window size | cores | time (ms) | | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | | 640x480 | 20x20 | 1 | ~50 |

    ROC for npddetect::prescandetect :
