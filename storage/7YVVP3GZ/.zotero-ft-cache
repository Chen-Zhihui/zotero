Dlib is a general purpose cross-platform software library written in the programming language C++ . Its design is heavily influenced by ideas from design by contract and component-based software engineering . Thus it is, first and foremost, a set of independent software components. It is open-source software released under a Boost Software License .

Since development began in 2002, Dlib has grown to include a wide variety of tools. As of 2016, it contains software components for dealing with networking , threads , graphical user interfaces , data structures , linear algebra , machine learning , image processing , data mining , XML and text parsing, numerical optimization , Bayesian networks , and many other tasks. In recent years, much of the development has been focused on creating a broad set of statistical machine learning tools and in 2009 Dlib was published in the Journal of Machine Learning Research . [2] Since then it has been used in a wide range of domains. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]
